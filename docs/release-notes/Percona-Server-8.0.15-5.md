# Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.15-5

*Percona* announces the release of *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.15-5 on March 15, 2019
(downloads are available [here](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/) and from the [Percona
Software Repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/installation.html#installing-from-binaries)).

This release includes fixes to bugs found in previous releases of *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.

Starting from the release `8.0.15-5` , *Percona Server for MySQL* uses the upstream
implementation of binary log encryption. The variable `encrypt_binlog` is
removed and the related command line option `--encrypt_binlog` is not
supported. It is important that you remove the `encrypt_binlog` variable from
your configuration file before you attempt to upgrade from either another
release in the *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0 series or *Percona Server for MySQL*
5.7. Otherwise, a server boot error reports an unknown
variable. The implemented binary log encryption is compatible with the old
format: the binary log encrypted in a previous version of MySQL 8.0 series or
Percona Server for MySQL are supported.

This release is based on *MySQL* 8.0.14 and 8.0.15. It includes all
bug fixes in these releases. *Percona Server for MySQL* Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.14 was skipped.

*Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.15-5 is now the current GA release in the 8.0
series. All of *Percona*â€™s software is open-source and free.

Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 includes all the [features available in MySQL 8.0
Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-nutshell.html) in addition to
enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.  For a list of highlighted
features from both MySQL 8.0 and Percona Server for MySQL 8.0, please see the
[GA release announcement](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/12/21/announcing-general-availability-of-percona-server-for-mysql-8-0/).

**NOTE**: If you are upgrading from 5.7 to 8.0, please ensure that you read the
[upgrade guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/upgrade.html) and
the document [Changed in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/changed_in_version.html).
