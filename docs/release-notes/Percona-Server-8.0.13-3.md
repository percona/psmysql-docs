# Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.13-3

*Percona* announces the GA release of *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.13-3 on December 21, 2018
(downloads are available [here](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/) and from the [Percona
SoftwareRepositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/installation.html#installing-from-binaries)).
This release merges changes of *MySQL* 8.0.13, including all the bug fixes in
it. *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.13-3 is now the current GA release in the 8.0
series. All of *Percona*â€™s software is open-source and free.

Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 includes all the [features available in MySQL 8.0
Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-nutshell.html) in addition to
enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.  For a list of
highlighted features from both MySQL 8.0 and Percona Server for MySQL 8.0,
please see the [GA release announcement](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/12/21/announcing-general-availability-of-percona-server-for-mysql-8-0/).

**NOTE**: If you are upgrading from 5.7 to 8.0, please ensure that you read the
[upgrade guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/upgrade.html) and the
document [Changed in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/changed_in_version.html).

## Features Removed in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0


* Slow Query Log Rotation and Expiration: Not widely used, can be accomplished
using `logrotate`


* CSV engine mode for standard-compliant quote and comma parsing


* Expanded program option modifiers


* The `ALL_O_DIRECT` InnoDB flush method: it is not compatible with the
new redo logging implementation


* `XTRADB_RSEG` table from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`


* InnoDB memory size information from `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;` the
same information is available from Performance Schema memory summary
tables


* Query cache enhancements: The query cache is no longer present in
MySQL 8.0

## Features Being Deprecated in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0


* *TokuDB* Storage Engine: *TokuDB* will be supported throughout the *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0 release series, but will not be available in the next major
release. *Percona* encourages *TokuDB* users to explore the *MyRocks* Storage
Engine which provides similar benefits for the majority of workloads and has
better optimized support for modern hardware.
