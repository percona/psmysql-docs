* This release adds a new MyRocks Information Schema Table `ROCKSDB_LIVE_FILES_METADATA`.

* This release removes `rocksdb_instant_ddl` variable. Use `rocksdb_disable_instant_ddl` instead. 

* This merge fixes the following issues:
  
  * [PS-8477](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8477): The offline-mode persisted when doing `dba.rebootClusterFromCompleteOutage`. 

  * [PS-8699](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8699): `ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD TLS` hung with many concurrent connection attempts. We have included the upstream fix and added our fix for this issue, which significantly reduces the chances that the issue will reoccur.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.33 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The `INSTALL COMPONENT` includes the `SET` clause. The `SET` clause sets the values of component system variables when installing one or several components. This reduces the inconvenience and limitations associated with assigning variable values in other ways.

* The mysqlbinlog `--start-position` accepts values up to `18446744073709551615`. If the `--read-from-remote-server` or `--read-from-remote-source` option is used, the maximum is `4294967295`. (Bug #77818, Bug #21498994)

* Using a generated column with `DEFAULT(col_name)` to specify the default value for a named column is not allowed and throws an error message. (Bug #34463652, Bug #34369580)

* Not all possible error states were reported during the binary log recovery process. (Bug #33658850)

* User-defined collations are deprecated. The usage of the following user-defined collations causes a warning that is written to the log:

  * When `COLLATE` is followed by the name of a user-defined collation in an SQL statement.

  * When the name of a user-defined collation is used as the value of `collation_server`, `collation_database`, or `collation_connection`.

The support for user-defined collations will be removed in a future releases of MySQL.

## New features

* [PS-8188](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8188): Adds the `clone_exclude_plugins_list` variable. By default, the list of installed plugins on the donor and recipient must match. The `clone_exclude_plugins_list` variable allows for specifying the list of plugin exceptions.

## Bug fixes

* [PS-8647](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8647): `tmp_table_size=51200` caused server exit.

* [PS-8683](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8683): Concurrent execution of `FLUSH STATUS`, `COM_CHANGE_USER`, and `SELECT FROM I_S.PROCESSLIST` led to deadlock. The deadlock affected connections executing the mentioned commands and other connections and made it impossible to shut down the server properly.

* [PS-8713](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8713): `mysql_binlog_xxx()` symbols were not exported in `lybmysqlclient.so`.

* [PS-8719](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8719): Audit log plugin stalled on flush.

* [PS-8747](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8747): When Federated SE internal proxy-server connection timeout occured, `Got an error writing communication packets` was reported back to the user while the actual operation was successful.
