## Release highlights

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.31 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* MySQL adds support for the SQL standard [`INTERSECT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/intersect.html) and [`EXCEPT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/except.html) table operators.

* InnoDB supports parallel index builds. This improves index build performance. The sorted index entries are loaded into a B-tree in a multithread. In previous releases, this action was performed by a single thread.

* The Performance and sys schemas show metrics for the global and session memory limits introduced in MySQL 8.0.28.

    The following columns have been added to the Performance Schema tables:

    | Performance Schema tables                                                            | Columns                                                   |
    | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
    | SETUP_INSTRUMENTS                                                                    | FLAGS                                                     |
    | THREADS                                                                              | CONTROLLED_MEMORY, MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY, TOTAL_MEMORY, MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY |
    | EVENTS_STATEMENTS_CURRENT, EVENTS_STATEMENTS_HISTORY, EVENTS_STATEMENTS_HISTORY_LONG | MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY, MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY                   |
    | Statement Summary Tables                                                             | MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY, MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY                   |
    | Performance Schema Connection Tables                                                 | MAX_SESSION_CONTROLLED_MEMORY, MAX_SESSION_TOTAL_MEMORY   |
    | PREPARED_STATEMENTS_INSTANCES                                                        | MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY, MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY                   |

    The following columns have been added to the sys schema `STATEMENT_ANALYSIS` and `X$STATEMENT_ANALYSIS` views:

    * MAX_CONTROLLED_MEMORY

    * MAX_TOTAL_MEMORY

    The `controlled_by_default` flag has been added to the `PROPERTIES` column of the `SETUP_INSTRUMENTS` table.

    Now, you can add and remove non-global memory instruments to the set of controlled-memory instruments. To do this, set the value of the `FLAGS` column of `SETUP_INSTRUMENTS`.

    ```sql
    SQL> UPDATE PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.SETUP_INTRUMENTS SET FLAGS="controlled" 
    WHERE NAME='memory/sql/NET::buff';
    ```

* The `audit_log_flush` variable has been deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

## Improvements

* [PS-7963](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-7963): The trigger definitions are not cached in the table cache when using SELECT statements. This improvement adds the following variables:

    * [`table_open_cache_triggers`](../flexibility/trigger-updates.md#tableopencachetriggers) system variable

    * [`table_open_cache_triggers_hits`, `table_open_cache_triggers_misses`, and `table_open_cache_triggers_overflows`](../flexibility/trigger-updates.md#status-variables) status variables
	
* [PS-8433](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8433): Reduces memory spent when caching triggers by replacing a fixed-size error buffer with a variable-size error buffer.

* [PS-8593](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8593): The binary tarballs compiled in the `RelWithDebInfo` configuration include full `("-g")` rather than minimal `("-g1")` debug information.

* [PS-8553](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8553): The Oracle Linux 9 RPM packages are now built with ZenFS enabled.

* [PS-7923](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-7923): Assertion `owned_gtids.is_owned_by(thd->owned_gtid, thd->thread_id())` failed.

* [PS-8106](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8106): MySQL exited when the replication was stopped on replicating a `CREATE TABLE AS` statement.

* [PS-8128](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8128): An in-place upgrade of views that refer to `performance_schema` tables failed.

* [PS-8328](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8328): MySQL 8.0 exited when using `group_concat` with `group by with rollup`.

* [PS-8503](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8503): `checkpoint_age` related status had no value. (Thanks to Huang Zhiyong for reporting this issue.)

* [PS-8547](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8547): Added a space after the binary name to count all active processes, including processes started by the binary. (Thanks to user Elbandi for reporting this issue.)

* [PS-8589](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8589): The replica crashed with fatal signal 11.

* [PS-8327](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8327): The usage of `ALTER TABLE ... CHECK PARTITION` inside stored procedure failed.

* [PS-8442](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8442): A fix for a crash in `buf_pool_invalidate_instance()`.
