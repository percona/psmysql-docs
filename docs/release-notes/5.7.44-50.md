# Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.44-50 (2024-06-19)

This release is part of {{post}}. The fixes are available to [MySQL 5.7 Post-EOL Support from Percona customers]. Community members can [build this release from the source]. We recommend that you upgrade to MySQL 8.0 or you can stay on 5.7; we'll support you either way.

## Release Information

Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.44-50 builds upon the functionality and bug fixes in MySQL 5.7.44 Community Edition. It adds enterprise-grade features and security enhancements developed by Percona.

Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.44-50 contains the following fixes.

## Bug fixes

* [Bug#36248967]: `mysqldump` sometimes failed to identify the version number correctly.

* [Bug#35904044]: The server sometimes sent incorrect metadata to the client for specific queries.

* [Bug#35846221]: An error occurred because the `Item_func_make_set::fix_after_pullout()` function was missing. This makes the `MAKE_SET` function appear constant (const), causing it to be evaluated too early during the process (resolving). We fixed this by implementing the missing `fix_after_pullout()` function.

* [Bug#35854362]: Queries that used a group by loose index scan occasionally returned inaccurate results.

* [Bug#36093405]: Implemented better management of GTID sets in Group Replication.

* [Bug#35277407]: Transactions stopped unexpectedly. This bug occurred when the system encountered an incorrect value stored in the `trx->in_innodb` variable.

* [Bug#36317795]: Ensured that calling the `plugin->deinit` function resulted in the same behavior for all plugins. All plugins follow a consistent process when being unloaded or shut down.

* [Bug#36343647]: Addressed buffer handling during the tablespace deletion process. This issue could have caused the program to halt with an assertion failure in the past.

* [Bug#34929814]: The Full-Text Search (FTS) system encountered issues maintaining consistency when multiple operations happened simultaneously (concurrent scenarios).

* [PS-9092]: A high rate of page splits and merges in the past caused data inconsistencies.

* [PS-9132]: After an unexpected server exit, persistent information about executed Global Transaction Identifiers (GTIDs) was lost during the `Gtid_state::save` operation.
