This release is part of {{post}}. The fixes are available to [MySQL 5.7 Post-EOL Support from Percona customers]. Community members can [build this release from the source]. We recommend that you upgrade to MySQL 8.0 or you can stay on 5.7; we'll support you either way.

## Release Information

Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.44-51 builds upon the functionality and bug fixes in MySQL 5.7.44 Community Edition. It adds enterprise-grade features and security enhancements developed by Percona.


Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.44-51 contains the following fixes.

## Bug fixes

### Security fix

* [Bug #36563773]: The calculation of averages for some numbers was sometimes incorrect.

### Non-security fixes

* [Bug #35205358]: The `conn_delay/Waiting` stage in the connection_control plugin was not reset after a delay caused by the plugin, leading to inaccurate monitoring data.

* [Bug #34929814]: Running two OPTIMIZE TABLE commands at the same time on a table with fulltext indexes and innodb_optimize_fulltext_only enabled sometimes made the server shut down.

* [Bug #29539976]: In the CONNECTION_CONTROL plugin, the Performance Schema couldnâ€™t find specific keys until the code using them ran.

* [Bug #35894664]: The result from a spatial index that included a column with a spatial reference identifier (SRID) was empty. Additionally, using FORCE INDEX to enforce a covering index scan on the spatial index caused an assertion error.

* [Bug #33142654], [Bug #36543458]: Adds an additional check on the QT_NO_TABLE flag before accessing table_name to fix HEAP-USE-AFTER-FREE errors.

* [Bug #33057164]: The PROCESSLIST_INFO column of THREADS did not update when a prepared statement was executed.

* [Bug #34800754]: An InnoDB assertion error happened due to an invalid column index, even though the column index was valid.

* [Bug #36252805]: To check if the binlog cache was empty, it had to be created first, which made it empty. This caused sessions that never needed a binlog cache to get one, using up resources unnecessarily.
