This update to the release notes adds the Deprecation and removal section.

## Release highlights

The following features are [Generally Available (GA)](../glossary.md#general-availability-ga):

* [Amazon Key Management Service](../using-amz-kms.md)
  
* [Key Management Interoperability Protocol](../using-kmip.md)

The following features, variables, or options are available only in [tech preview](../glossary.md#tech-preview):

* [SASL-based LDAP plugin](../ldap-authentication.md)

* [SASL-based LDAP variables](../ldap-system-variables.md)

* [Fallback server variables for simple LDAP and SASL-based LDAP](../ldap-system-variables.md)

* [FIDO authentication plugin](../fido-authentication-plugin.md)

* Group Replication options

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for *MySQL* 8.0.30 and included in *Percona Server for MySQL* are the following:

* Supports Generated Invisible Primary Keys(GIPK). This feature automatically adds a primary key to InnoDB tables without a primary key. The generated key is always named `my_row_id`. The GIPK feature is not enabled by default. Enable the feature by setting `sql_generate_invisible_primary_key` to ON.

* The InnoDB_doublewrite system has two new settings:

  * `DETECT_ONLY`. This setting allows only metadata to be written to the doublewrite buffer. Database page content is not written to the buffer. Recovery does not use the buffer to fix incomplete page writes. Use this setting only when you need to detect incomplete page writes.

  * `DETECT_AND_RECOVER`. This setting is equivalent to the current ON setting. The doublewrite buffer is enabled. Database page content is written to the buffer and the buffer is accessed to fix incomplete page writes during recovery.

* The `-skip_host_cache` server option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use `SET GLOBAL host_cache_size`= 0 or set `host_cache_size` = 0.

## New features

* [PS-8255](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8255): Added support to enable users to authenticate using [FIDO authentication](../fido-authentication-plugin.md).
  
* [PS-6002](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-6002): Added the global variable [`--replica-enable-event`](../group-replication-system-variables.md#replica-enable-event) to maintain the create/alter event state on replicas.
  
* [PS-7980](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-7980): Added the global system variables [`--authentication_ldap_simple_group_role_mapping`](../ldap-system-variables.md#authentication_ldap_simple_group_role_mapping) and [`--authentication_ldap_sasl_group_role_mapping`](../ldap-system-variables.md#authentication_ldap_sasl_group_role_mapping). When a user logs in with LDAP authentication, the server checks if the LDAP user is a member of any group specified in this variable. If the check is successful, the matching MySQL roles are automatically granted to the user.
  
* [PS-8275](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8275): Implements the ability to eject a cluster node when the node exceeds the flow control threshold by adding a `MAJORITY` mode to [`group_replication_flow_control_mode`](../group-replication-system-variables.md#group-replication-flow-control-mode) and a global system variable [`group_replication_auto_evict_timeout`](../group-replication-system-variables.md#group-replication-auto-evict-timeout).

## Improvements

* [PS-8385](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8385): Adds the ability to call user-defined functions to register a redo log consumer. A consumer reading the redo log blocks files from being deleted or purged.

* [PS-8169](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8169): Adds the ability to use Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) to send secure messages within the LDAP protocol with the SASL-based LDAP authentication. The [`authentication_ldap_sasl` plugin](../ldap-authentication.md) performs the SASL-based LDAP authentication on the server. The client must use the `authentication_ldap_sasl_client` plugin.
  
* [PS-8155](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8155): Implements support for multiple LDAP server for the simple LDAP authentication plugin and the SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin. If the appropriate system variable is set, and if the primary server is unavailable, the authentication plugin attempts to connect and authenticate using a fallback server. A user can also specify multiple fallback servers. The following global system variables are:
  
  * [`authentication_ldap_simple_fallback_server_host`](../ldap-system-variables.md#authentication-ldap-simple-fallback-server-host)
  
  * [`authentication_ldap_simple_fallback_server_port`](../ldap-system-variables.md#authentication-ldap-simple-fallback-server-port)
  
  * [`authentication_ldap_sasl_fallback_server_host`](../ldap-system-variables.md#authentication-ldap-sasl-fallback-server-host)
  
  * [`authentication_ldap_sasl_fallback_server_port`](../ldap-system-variables.md#authentication-ldap-sasl-fallback-server-port)

## Bug fixes

* [PS-8204](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8204/): A fix for when the `audit_log_format` was set to XML and the logged queries were truncated after a newline character.

* [PS-8246](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8246): Adapted the Encryption UDF MTR test cases to OpenSL 3.0.x. The tests failed because OpenSSL 3.0.x has a different default set of hash functions and PEM reading and writing routines generate different error messages.

* [PS-8351](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8351): The `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` would output unreadable UTF characters.

* [PS-8364](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8364): When using Docker, the data directory for ICU regular expressions was missing.

* [PS-8175](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8175): While a thread executes `fil_io_set_encryption()`, another thread may change the `space->encryption_type`. If this happens, an assertion in `fil_io_set_encryption()` caused an unexpected server exit.

* [PS-8428](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8428): A fix for an unexpected server exit when `--innodb_encrypt_online_alter_logs`=ON and `ALTER TABLE <tablename> ADD FULLTEXT` was executed.

## Platform support

* Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.30 supports Oracle Linux/Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

* Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.30 supports Ubuntu 22.04.

## Deprecation and removal

This release removes the [Data Scrubbing](../data-scrubbing.md) feature.

The `master_key` and `keyring_key` options are removed in the [`innodb_redo_log_encrypt`](../encrypting-redo-log.md#innodb_redo_log_encrypt) variable. The data type is changed to Boolean.
