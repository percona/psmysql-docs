## Release highlights

Improvements and bug fixes provided by Oracle for *MySQL* 5.7.40 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* ISO 8601 timestamps in log messages did not consider daylight saving time when `--log-timestamps=SYSTEM` was used.

* The `GRANT OPTION` privilege was treated as related to database operations.

* In specific cases, a `TRUNCATE TABLE` operation failed to release an acquired mutex.

* A descending b-tree scan raised a debug assertion failure in debug builds.

Find the full list of bug fixes and changes in the [MySQL 5.7.40 Release Notes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-40.html).

## Bug fixes

* [PS-1098](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-1098): Manually rotating the log files by calling `audit_log_flush` multiple times caused incorrect file rotation and the wrong log file to be used.
* [PS-8327](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8327): `ALTER TABLE ... CHECK PARTITION` inside the stored procedure caused a server exit.
