# Percona Server for MySQL 8.1.0-1 (2023-11-27)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona Server for MySQL].

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.1.0-1] includes all the features and bug fixes available in the
MySQL 8.1 Community Edition in addition to enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

Percona Server for MySQL is a freely available, fully compatible, enhanced, and open source drop-in replacement for any MySQL database. It provides superior and optimized performance, greater scalability, and availability, enhanced backups, increased visibility and instrumentation.

Percona Server for MySQL is trusted by thousands of enterprises to provide better performance and concurrency for their most demanding workloads.

## Release highlights

Percona Server for MySQL implements telemetry that fills in the gaps in our understanding of how you use Percona Server to improve our products. Participation in the anonymous program is optional. You can opt-out if you prefer not to share this information. Find more information in the [Telemetry on Percona Server for MySQL](../telemetry.md) document.

The following user-defined function (UDF) shared objects (so) are converted to components:

* The `data_masking` plugin converted into the `component_masking_functions` component
* The `binlogs_utils_udf` UDF shared object (.so) converted to the `component_binlog_utils` component
* The `percona-udf` UDF shared object (.so) converted to the `component_percona-udf` component

A user does not need to execute a separate `CREATE FUNCTION ... SONAME ...` statement for each function. Installing the components with the `INSTALL COMPONENT 'file://componenet_xxx` statement performs the auto-registration operations.

The `keyring_vault` plugin converted into the `component_keyring_vault` component. This conversion aligns the keyring_vault with the KMIP and KMS keyrings and supports "ALTER INSTANCE RELOAD KEYRING" to update the configuration automatically.

The `audit_log_filter` plugin converted to the `component_audit_log_filter` component. The following changes are also available:

* Adds the `mysql_event_tracking_parse` audit log event
* Reworked, optimized, and reorganized the audit event data members
* Data deduplication within the audit event data members

The current version of `percona-release` does not support the `setup` subcommand with the `ps-8x-innovation` repository. Use `percona-release enable` instead. The support of the `ps-8x-innovation` repository for the `setup` subcommand will be added in the next release of `percona-release`.

The PS 8.1.0 MTR suites are reorganized. The existing percona-specific MTR test cases are regrouped and put into separate test suites:

* component_encryption_udf
* percona
* percona_innodb

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.1 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` can output the data to a user variable.

* New messages written to the MySQL error log during shutdown:

    * Startup and shutdown log messages, including when the server was started with `--initialize`

    * Start and end of shutdown phases for plugins and components

    * Start-of-phase and end-of-phase messages for connection closing phases

    * The number and ID of threads still alive after being forcibly disconnected and potentially causing a wait
