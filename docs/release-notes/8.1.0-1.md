Percona Server for MySQL is trusted by thousands of enterprises to provide better performance and concurrency for their most demanding workloads.

## Release highlights

Percona Server for MySQL implements telemetry that fills in the gaps in our understanding of how you use Percona Server to improve our products. Participation in the anonymous program is optional. You can opt-out if you prefer not to share this information. Find more information in the [Telemetry on Percona Server for MySQL](../telemetry.md) document.

The following components are added:

* `keyring_vault`
* `masking_functions`
* `binlog_utils`
* `percona-udf`
* `audit_log`

Converting a UDF shared object (.so) into a component simplifies the registration or unregistration of functions. Rather than a series of `CREATE FUNCTION ... SONAME` calls for each individual function, the user can call `INSTALL COMPONENT`.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.1 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` can output the data to a user variable.

* New messages written to the MySQL error log during shutdown:

    * Startup and shutdown log messages, including when the server was started with `--initialize`

    * Start and end of shutdown phases for plugins and components

    * Start-of-phase and end-of-phase messages for connection closing phases

    * The number and ID of threads still alive after being forcibly disconnected and potentially causing a wait

## Deprecation or removal

* The `mysql_native_password` authentication plugin is deprecated and subject to removal in a future version.
* The TokuDB storage engine is removed.
* The MyRocks ZenFS support is removed.
* The `libreadline` dependency library (used for command-line clients to maintain command history) is removed.
* The `keyring_value` plugin is removed.
* The `data_masking` UDF shared object (.so) is removed.
* The `binlog_utils_udf` UDF shared object (.so) is removed.
* The `percona_udf` UDF shared object (.so) is removed.
* The `audit_log` v1 plugin is removed.
