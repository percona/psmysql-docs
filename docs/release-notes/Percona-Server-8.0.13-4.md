# Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.13-4

*Percona* announces the release of *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.13-4 on
January 17, 2019 (downloads are available [here](https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/) and from
the [Percona Software Repositories](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/installation.html#installing-from-binaries)).
This release contains a fix for a critical bug that prevented *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7.24-26 from being upgraded to version 8.0.13-3 if there
were more than around 1000 tables, or if the maximum allocated InnoDB
table ID was around 1000. *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0.13-4 is now the
current GA release in the 8.0 series. All of *Percona*’s software is
open-source and free.

Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 includes all the [features available in MySQL 8.0
Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-nutshell.html) in addition to
enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.  For a list of
highlighted features from both MySQL 8.0 and Percona Server for MySQL 8.0,
please see the [GA release announcement](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/12/21/announcing-general-availability-of-percona-server-for-mysql-8-0/).

**NOTE**: If you are upgrading from 5.7 to 8.0, please ensure that you read the
[upgrade guide](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/upgrade.html) and the
