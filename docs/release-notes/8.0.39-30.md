# Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.39-30 (2024-10-08)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona Server for MySQL](../quickstart-overview.md).

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.39-30](https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server) includes all the features and bug fixes available in the [MySQL 8.0.38 Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-38.html) and [MySQL 8.0.39 Community Edition](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-39.html) and enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

## Release highlights

Improvements and bug fixes provided by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.38, MySQL 8.0.39 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The server could not restart successfully after creating a large number of tables (8001 or more). This issue, Bug #36808732, is a regression of Bug #33398681.

* Enhanced performance of tablespace file scanning during startup. (Bug #110402, Bug #35200385)

* InnoDB file system operations now consistently perform an fsync on the parent directory when carrying out directory-altering tasks. (Bug #36174938)

* Worker jobs now include details about the relay log file that initiated the transaction, rather than relying on the default specified by `relay_log`.

## Improvements

* [PS-9233](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9233): Adds the [UUID_VX component](../uuid-versions.md) which provides a set of functions for generating and working with various versions of the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).

##  Bug fixes

* [PS-8057](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-8057): The variable `slow_query_log_file` at runtime did not match the value defined in the `my.cnf` file.

* [PS-9214](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9214): An `ALTER TABLE` operation that rebuilt an InnoDB table using the `INPLACE` algorithm could occasionally fail with an unwarranted duplicate primary key error. This could happen if there were concurrent insertions, even though theose insertions did not cause any primary key conflict.

* [PS-9314](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9314): There was no connection to the server because mysqld received signal 11 when using `JSON_TABLE`.

* [PS-9286](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9286): The Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) component left keys in a `pre-active` state.

* [PS-9306](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9306): MySQL versions 8.0.38, 8.4.1, and 9.0.0 exited upon restarting if the database contained 10,000 or more tables.

* [PS-9322](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9322): When `super_read_only=1` is enabled, undo truncation couldn't update the data dictionary (DD), resulting in orphaned truncate log files.

* [PS-9379](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9379): On some platforms, using the `-l atomic` flag could cause a compilation error because the compiler already has built-in support for atomic operations and does not require linking to the atomic library.

* [PS-9144](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9144): In-place `ALTER TABLE` operations that internally rebuilt tables sometimes resulted in lost rows if a concurrent purge happened.
