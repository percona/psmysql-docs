# Percona Server for MySQL 8.2.0-1 (2024-02-05)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona Server for MySQL].

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.2.0-1] includes all the features and bug fixes available in the
MySQL 8.2 Community Edition in addition to enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

## Release highlights

This release merges the MySQL 8.2 code base. Withing this merge Percona introduces several sagnificant changes:

* Removes remainders of Percona-specific encryption features (support for custom Percona 5.7 encrypted bilnog format.)

* Removes the deprecated `rocksdb_strict_collation_check` and `rocksdb_strict_collation_exceptions` RocksDB system variables.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.2 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The insert operations caused `records_in_range` to read too many disk blocks.

* System schema tables with INSTANT ADD columns created before 8.0.29 are incompatible with MySQL versions higher than 8.0.29. Performing DMLs on these tables causes an unexpected server exit.

* A FTS parser plugin now handles single character tokens correctly.

## Known issues

* [PS-9078](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9078): An upgrade on Ubuntu 20.04 from the following releases does not restart the MySQL service automatically. You must start the service manually.

    * Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.x to Percona Server for MySQL 8.1

    * Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.x to Percona Server for MySQL 8.2

    * Percona Server for MySQL 8.1 to Percona Server for MySQL 8.2

## Deprecation or removal

A future release may remove deprecated variables and options. The usage of these deprecated items may cause a warning. We recommend migrating from deprecated variables and options as soon as possible.

This release deprecates the following variables and options:

* The `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` server system variable

* The `old` and `new` server system variables

* The `--character-set-client-handshake` server variable

* `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST`

* The implementation of the `SHOW PROCESSLIST` command that uses the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST` table

* The `performance_schema_show_processlist` variable

This release removes the following variables and options:

* The `WAIT_UNTIL_SQL_THREAD_AFTER_GTIDS()` SQL function. Attempting to invoke this function now causes a syntax error. Use `WAIT_FOR_EXECUTED_GTID_SET()` instead.

* The `--abort-slave-event-count` and `--disconnect-slave-event-count` server startup options. Attempting to use these options now results in an error.

* The `expire_logs_days` server system variable. Attempting to use this variable now results in an error. Use the `binlog_expire_logs_seconds` variable instead.
