# Percona Server for MySQL 8.4.2-2 (2024-09-)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona Server for MySQL].

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.4.2-2] includes all the features and bug fixes available in the
MySQL 8.4 Community Edition in addition to enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

## Release highlights

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.4.1 and 8.4.2 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* MySQL stopped unexpectedly during an UPDATE after an ALTER TABLE operation.

* Shutting down the server after an XA START with an empty XA transaction caused it to stop unexpectedly.

* Shutting down the replication applier or binlog applier during an empty XA transaction caused the system to stop unexpectedly.

* The result from a spatial index with a column containing a spatial reference identifier (SRID) was empty. Using FORCE INDEX to scan this index caused an assertion error.

* In some cases, after creating more than 8000 tables, the server failed to restart. 

* Startup tablespace file scanning performance was improved.
