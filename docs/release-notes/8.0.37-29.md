* [PS-9219](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9219): While converting the charset collation in a table, MySQL converted the date and time data types columns in the `.ibd` file. However, the `collation_id` in the `.ibd` file did not align with that of the data dictionary.

## Deprecation

* [PS-8963](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-8963): The `SEQUENCE_TABLE()` function is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. We recommend that you use `PERCONA_SEQUENCE_TABLE()` instead. To maintain compatibility with existing third-party software, `SEQUENCE_TABLE` is no longer a reserved term and can be used as a regular identifier.
