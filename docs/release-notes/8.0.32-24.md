## Release highlights

Percona decided to revert the following MySQL bug fix:

    The data and the GTIDs backed up by mysqldump were inconsistent when the options --single-transaction and --set-gtid-purged=ON were both used. It was because in between the transaction started by mysqldump and the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED, GTIDs on the server could have increased already. With this fixed, a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is performed before the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED to ensure its value is consistent with the snapshot taken by mysqldump.

    The current Percona decision also provides a solution for [MySQL bug #33630199](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=109701).

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.32 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* A replica can add a Generated Invisible Primary Keys(GIPK) to any InnoDB table. To achieve this behavior, the GENERATE value is added as a possible value for the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statementâ€™s REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK option.

REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK = GENERATE option can be used on a per-channel basis.

Setting sql_generate_invisible_primary_key on the source is ignored by a replica because this variable is not replicated. This behavior is inherited from the previous releases.

## Bug fixes

* [PS-8073](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8073) : Replication crash when updating a table with a stored generated field in the primary key.

* [PS-8577](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8577) :
