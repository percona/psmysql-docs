## Release highlights

* Percona reverts the following MySQL bug fix:

    The data and the GTIDs backed up by mysqldump were inconsistent when the options --single-transaction and --set-gtid-purged=ON were both used. It was because in between the transaction started by mysqldump and the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED, GTIDs on the server could have increased already. With this fixed, a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is performed before the fetching of GTID_EXECUTED to ensure its value is consistent with the snapshot taken by mysqldump.

    The MySQL fix also added a requirement when using [--single-transaction](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysqldump.html#option_mysqldump_single-transaction) and executing FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK for the [RELOAD](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_reload) privilege. ([MySQL bug #109701](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=109701), [MySQL bug #105761](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=105761))

    The Percona Server version of the `mysqldump` utility, in some modes, can be used with MySQL Server. This utility provides a temporary workaround for the "additional RELOAD privilege" limitation introduced by Oracle MySQL Server 8.0.32. 

    For more information, see the Percona Performance Blog [A Workaround for the "RELOAD/FLUSH_TABLES privilege required" Problem When Using Oracle mysqldump 8.0.32](https://www.percona.com/blog/workaround-for-the-reload-flush_tables-privilege-required-problem-when-using-oracle-mysqldump-8-0-32/).

* In [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.29-21](8.0.29-21.md), the default ALTER TABLE algorithm was deliberately changed from `INSTANT` to `INPLACE` for safety reasons (find more details in [Percona XtraBackup 8.0.29 and INSTANT ADD/DROP Columns](https://www.percona.com/blog/percona-xtrabackup-8-0-29-and-instant-add-drop-columns/) blog post.) Since Oracle fixed the most critical bugs related to `ALGORITHM=INSTANT` in MySQL 8.0.32, Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.32-24 returns the original (upstream) behavior. Now, the default ALTER TABLE algorithm for [supported DDL column operations](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html) is `INSTANT`.  

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.0.32 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* A replica can add a Generated Invisible Primary Keys(GIPK) to any InnoDB table. To achieve this behavior, the GENERATE value is added as a possible value for the CHANGE REPLICATION SOURCE TO statement’s REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK option.

* The `REQUIRE_TABLE_PRIMARY_KEY_CHECK = GENERATE` option can be used on a per-channel basis.

* Setting `sql_generate_invisible_primary_key` on the source is ignored by a replica because this variable is not replicated. This behavior is inherited from the previous releases.

* An upgrade from 8.0.28 caused undetectable problems, such as server exit and corruption.

* A fix for after an upgrade, all columns added with ALGORITHM=INSTANT materialized and have version=0 for any new row inserted. Now, a column added with ALGORITHM=INSTANT fails if the maximum possible size of a row exceeds the row size limit, so that all new rows with materialized ALGORITHM=INSTANT columns are within row size limit. (Bug #34558510)

* After a drop, adding a specific column using the INSTANT algorithm could cause a data error and a server exit. (Bug #34122122)

* An online rebuild DDL no longer crashes after a column is added with ALGORITHM=INSTANT. Thank you Qingda Hu for reporting this bug. (Bug #33788578, Bug #106279)
