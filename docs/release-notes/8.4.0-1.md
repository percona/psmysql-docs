# Percona Server for MySQL 8.4.0-1 (2024-08-28)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona Server for MySQL].

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.4.0-1] includes all the features and bug fixes available in the
MySQL 8.4 Community Edition in addition to enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

## Release highlights

In MySQL 8.0, the release model changed to include new features in patch releases, allowing MySQL to introduce new features more frequently. However, this approach was complex for projects and applications needing only critical patches with minimal changes.

MySQL then moved to a versioning model with two options: Innovation releases and Long-Term Support (LTS) releases. Both types are production-ready.

Innovation releases offer access to the latest features, making them ideal for dynamic environments with strong automated testing and continuous integration.

Changes were made to each Innovation release that are now included in the 8.4 (LTS) release. You should review the Innovation release notes for details.

- [Percona Server for MySQL 8.1.0-1 (2023-11-27)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/innovation-release/release-notes/8.1.0-1.html)

- [Percona Server for MySQL 8.2.0-1 (2024-02-05)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/innovation-release/release-notes/8.2.0-1.html)

- [Percona Server for MySQL 8.3.0-1 (2024-04-16)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/innovation-release/release-notes/8.3.0-1.html)

LTS releases are more suitable for stable, established environments where minimal changes are needed. These releases include only essential fixes, reducing the risk of changes in the database softwareâ€™s behavior.

This 8.4.0-1 release is the first 8.4 LTS series.

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.4 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The MySQL native password has been deprecated and is no longer loaded by default. However, it can be loaded if needed.

* The clone plugin allows cloning between different point releases within the same series. You only must match the major and minor version numbers for cloning.

* GTIDs (Global Transaction Identifiers) can now handle groups of transactions, which helps speed up processing.

* `mysqldump` can now create output for older versions of MySQL.

* Automatic updates for histograms. When enabled, the histogram updates automatically whenever `ANALYZE TABLE` is run on the table. InnoDB's automatic recalculation of persistent statistics also updates the histogram when automatic updates are enabled.

* Adds a new privilege called FLUSH_PRIVILEGES. This privilege explicitly allows the use of FLUSH PRIVILEGES statements. Unlike the RELOAD privilege, FLUSH_PRIVILEGES only applies to FLUSH PRIVILEGES statements.

* The terms "MASTER" and "SLAVE" in replication commands are being replaced with "SOURCE" and "REPLICA". This change is part of an ongoing effort to use more inclusive language.

* Removed the the `mysqlpump` utility.

* Removed the `mysql_upgrade` utility.

* The default values for specific InnoDB server system variables have changed. See [What is new in MySQL 8.4 since 8.0](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.4/en/mysql-nutshell.html) for details.

## New features

* [PS-9233](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9233): Adds the [UUID_VX component](../uuid-versions.md) which provides a set of functions for generating and working with various versions of the Universally Unique Identifier (UUID).

## Improvements

* [PS-9302](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9302): Changed underlying internal data structure used by the binlog transaction dependency tracking in `WRITESET` mode (MySQL 8.4 removed the `COMMIT_ORDER` mode). Instead of `std::map` (an RB-tree) we now use `std::unordered_map` (a hash) which gives much better performance for lookup operations. This change showed an up to 17% Queries per second (QPS) increase in the `oltp_inlist_update` workload.

## Bug fixes

* [PS-9092](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9092): There were data inconsistencies during a high rate of page split/merge.

* [PS-9121](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9121): MySQL exited when InnoDB failed to update a spatial index.

* [PS-9151](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9151): Percona server 8.0 build failed on CentOS 7 with `-DWITH_SSL=openssl11`.

* [PS-9219](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9219): While converting the charset collation in a table, MySQL converted the date and time data types columns in the `.ibd` file. However, the `collation_id` in the `.ibd` file did not align with that of the data dictionary.

* [PS-9155](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9155): The server exited during the execution of the complicated query with 9 CTEs.

* [PS-9235](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-9235): Keyring vault failed to work with `binlog_rotate_encryption_master_key_at_startup`.

## Deprecation

* [PS-8963](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PS-8963): The `SEQUENCE_TABLE()` function is deprecated and may be removed in a future release. We recommend that you use `PERCONA_SEQUENCE_TABLE()` instead. To maintain compatibility with existing third-party software, `SEQUENCE_TABLE` is no longer a reserved term and can be used as a regular identifier. Find more information in [PERCONA_SEQUENCE_TABLE(n) function](../percona-sequence-table.md)
