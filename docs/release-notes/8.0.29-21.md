* Added support for the IF NOT EXISTS option for the CREATE FUNCTION, CREATE PROCEDURE, and CREATE TRIGGER statements.


* Added support for ALTER TABLE … DROP COLUMN ALGORITHM=INSTANT.


* An anonymous user with the PROCESS privilege was unable to select processlist table rows.

!!! note

    Percona Server for MySQL has changed the default for [supported DDL column operations](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-online-ddl-operations.html) to ALGORITHM=INPLACE. This fixes the corruption issue with the INSTANT ADD/DROP COLUMNS (find more details in [PS-8292](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PS-8292).)

    In MySQL 8.0.29, the default setting for supported DDL operations is ALGORITHM=INSTANT. You can explicitly specify ALGORITHM=INSTANT in DDL column operations.
