# Percona Server for MySQL 8.3.0-1 (2024-04-16)

Get started with [Quickstart Guide for Percona Server for MySQL].

[Percona Server for MySQL 8.3.0-1] includes all the features and bug fixes available in the
MySQL 8.3 Community Edition in addition to enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.

## Release highlights

This release merges the MySQL 8.3 code base.

Within this merge, Percona updates the Binary Log UDFs to make them compatible with new tagged GTIDs (Global Transaction Identifiers).

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for MySQL 8.3 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* Implements tagged GTIDs to group related transactions. This helps enhance replication management and simplify tracking transaction dependencies.

* Adds the `explain_json_format_version` server system variable. This variable allows selection between two JSON output formats for `EXPLAIN FORMAT=JSON` statements. Version 1, the default, offers the linear format used in prior versions. Version 2 provides an access path-based format, ensuring better future MySQL Optimizer compatibility.

## Deprecation or removal

A future release may remove deprecated features, variables and options. The usage of these deprecated items may cause a warning. We recommend migrating from deprecated variables and options as soon as possible.

This release removes the following features, variables and options:

* The `FLUSH HOSTS` statement was deprecated in MySQL 8.0.23 and has been removed. To clear the host cache, use `TRUNCATE TABLE performance_schema.host_cache` or `mysqladmin flush-hosts`.

* The `--skip-host-cache` server option has been removed. Start the server with the `--host-cache-size=0` option instead.

* The `--character-set-client-handshake` and `--old-style-user-limits` server options.

* The usage of writesets for conflict checks when the row-based logging is in effect is restricted. If `binlog_transaction_dependency_tracking` is set to `WRITESET` or `WRITESET_SESSION`, the `binlog_format` must be `ROW`. The `MIXED` value is no longer supported.

* The [Multi-threaded LRU flusher](..//xtradb-performance-improvements.md#multi-threaded-lru-flusher) feature is no longer supported.

* The `innodb_parallel_doublewrite_path` and `innodb_parallel_dblwr_encrypt` server options were deprecated in Percona Server 8.0.23 and have had no effect since that time. These options have now been removed.
