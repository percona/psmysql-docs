# The Percona XtraDB storage engine

Percona XtraDB is an enhanced version of the *InnoDB* storage engine, designed
to better scale on modern hardware.  It also includes a variety of other
features useful in high-performance environments. It is fully backward
compatible, and so can be used as a drop-in replacement for standard *InnoDB*.

Percona XtraDB includes all of *InnoDB* ‘s robust, reliable `ACID`-compliant
design and advanced `MVCC` architecture, and builds on that solid foundation
with more features, more tunability, more metrics, and more scalability. In
particular, it is designed to scale better on many cores, use memory more
efficiently, and be more convenient and useful. The new features are
specially designed to alleviate some of *InnoDB*’s limitations. We choose
features and fixes based on customer requests and on our best judgment of
real-world needs as a high-performance consulting company.

Percona XtraDB engine will not have further binary releases, it is
distributed as part of the *Percona Server for MySQL*.
