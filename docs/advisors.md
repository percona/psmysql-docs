# Use Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) Advisors

[Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) provides several categories of Advisors. Each Advisor contains a set of automated checks. These checks investigate your database settings for a specific range of possible issues.

[The Percona Platform](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-platform) hosts the Advisors. 

The PMM Server automatically downloads the Advisors if the `Advisors` and `Telemetry` options are enabled in `Configuration > Settings > Advanced Settings`. Both options are enabled by default.
