# MyRocks status variables

MyRocks status variables provide details
about the inner workings of the storage engine
and they can be useful in tuning the storage engine
to a particular environment.

You can view these variables and their values by running:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'rocksdb%';
```

The following global status variables are available:
