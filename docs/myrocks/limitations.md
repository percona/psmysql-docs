# MyRocks Limitations

The MyRocks storage engine lacks the following features compared to InnoDB:


* [Online DDL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-online-ddl.html)


* [ALTER TABLE … EXCHANGE PARTITION](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/partitioning-management-exchange.html)


* [SAVEPOINT](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/savepoint.html)


* [Transportable tablespace](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-table-import.html)


* [Foreign keys](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-foreign-keys.html)


* [Spatial indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/using-spatial-indexes.html)


* [Fulltext indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-fulltext-index.html)


* [Gap locks](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-locking.html#innodb-gap-locks)


* [Group Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/group-replication.html)


* [Generated Columns](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/create-table-generated-columns.html)


* [Partial Update of LOB in InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/blog-archive/mysql-8-0-optimizing-small-partial-update-of-lob-in-innodb/)

You should also consider the following:


* `\*_bin` (e.g. `latin1_bin`) or binary collation should be used
on `CHAR` and `VARCHAR` indexed columns. The following binary collations
are supported: `binary`, `latin1_bin`, and `utf8_bin`.
By default, MyRocks prevents creating indexes with non-binary collations
(including `latin1`).
You can optionally use it by setting
rocksdb_strict_collation_exceptions to `t1`
(table names with regex format),
but non-binary covering indexes other than `latin1`
(excluding `german1`) still require a primary key lookup
to return the `CHAR` or `VARCHAR` column.


* Either `ORDER BY DESC` or `ORDER BY ASC` is slow.
This is because of “Prefix Key Encoding” feature in RocksDB.
See [http://www.slideshare.net/matsunobu/myrocks-deep-dive/58](http://www.slideshare.net/matsunobu/myrocks-deep-dive/58) for details.
By default, ascending scan is faster and descending scan is slower.
If the “reverse column family” is configured,
then descending scan will be faster and ascending scan will be slower.
Note that InnoDB also imposes a cost
when the index is scanned in the opposite order.


* MyRocks does not support operating as either a source or a replica
in any replication topology that is not exclusively row-based.
Statement-based and mixed-format binary logging is not supported.
For more information, see [Replication Formats](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-formats.html).


* When converting from large MyISAM/InnoDB tables, either by using the
`ALTER` or `INSERT INTO SELECT` statements it’s recommended that you
check the Data loading documentation and
create MyRocks tables as below (in case the table is sufficiently big it will
cause the server to consume all the memory and then be terminated by the OOM
killer):

```sql
 SET session sql_log_bin=0;
 SET session rocksdb_bulk_load=1;
 ALTER TABLE large_myisam_table ENGINE=RocksDB;
 SET session rocksdb_bulk_load=0;
```

You should see the following output:

```text
.. warning::

 If you are loading large data without enabling :ref:`rocksdb_bulk_load`
 or :ref:`rocksdb_commit_in_the_middle`, please make sure transaction
 size is small enough. All modifications of the ongoing transactions are
 kept in memory.
```


* The\`XA protocol <[https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa.html](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/xa.html)>\`_ support,
which allows distributed transactions combining multiple separate
transactional resources, is an experimental feature in MyRocks: the
implementation is less tested, it may lack some functionality and be not as
stable as in case of InnoDB.


* MySQL has [spatial data types](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/spatial-type-overview.html) . These data types are not supported by MyRocks.
