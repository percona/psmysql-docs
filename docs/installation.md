## Install Percona Server for MySQL from Repositories

Percona provides repositories for yum (`RPM` packages for Red Hat, CentOS and Amazon Linux AMI) and apt (`.deb` packages for Ubuntu and Debian) for software such as Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraBackup, and Percona Toolkit. This makes it easy to install and update your software and its dependencies through your operating systemâ€™s package manager. This is the recommended way of installing where possible.

The following guides describe the installation process for using the official Percona repositories for the `.deb` and `.rpm` packages.
