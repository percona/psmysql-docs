We recommend using the repositories that Percona provides to simplify the installation process. The percona-release tool makes it easy to install and update your software and its dependencies using your operating system package manager.

The Percona Software repositories contain YUM (`RPM` packages for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivatives) and APT (`DEB` packages for Ubuntu and Debian) for Percona software such as Percona Server for MySQL, Percona XtraBackup, and Percona Toolkit.

For more information see,  [Percona Software repositories and the percona-release tool].
