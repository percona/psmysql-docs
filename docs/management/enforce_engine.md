# Enforcing storage engine

*Percona Server for MySQL* has implemented variable which can be used for enforcing the
use of a specific storage engine.

When this variable is specified and a user tries to create a table using an
explicit storage engine that is not the specified enforced engine, the user
will get either an error if the `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` SQL mode is enabled
or a warning if `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` is disabled and the table
will be created anyway using the enforced engine (this is consistent with the
default *MySQL* way of creating the default storage engine if other engines
are not available unless `NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION` is set).

In case user tries to enable [enforce_storage_engine](#enforce_storage_engine) with engine that isn’t available, system will not start.

!!! note

    If you’re using enforce_storage_engine, you must either disable
    it before doing `mysql_upgrade` or perform `mysql_upgrade` with server
    started with `--skip-grants-tables`.

## Version specific information
