Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 comes with the TokuDB storage engine and MyRocks storage engine. These storage engines are installed as plugins.

Starting with [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19 (2022-05-12)](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.28-19.html), the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported. We have removed the storage engine from the installation packages and disabled the storage engine in our binary builds. For more information, see [TokuDB Introduction](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/8.0/tokudb/tokudb_intro.html).
