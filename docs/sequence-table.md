# SEQUENCE_TABLE(n) function

Percona Server for MySQL supports the SEQUENCE_TABLE() function.

A sequence of numbers can be defined as an arithmetic progression when the common difference between two consecutive terms is always the same.

The function is an inline table-valued function. A single SELECT statement generates a multi-row result set. In contrast, a scalar function (like [EXP(x)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{{vers}}/en/mathematical-functions.html#function_exp) or [LOWER(str)](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{{vers}}/en/string-functions.html#function_lower) always  returns a single value of a specific data type.

The [JSON_TABLE()](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{{vers}}/en/json-table-functions.html) is the only table function available in Oracle MySQL Server. `JSON_TABLE` and `SEQUENCE_TABLE()` are the only table functions available in Percona Server.

The basic syntax is the following:

* SEQUENCE_TABLE(n) [AS] alias

## Usage

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    SELECT â€¦ FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(n) [AS] alias

    SEQUENCE_TABLE(n>) [AS] alias
    ```

    `n:` The number of generated values.

As with any [derived tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{{vers}}/en/derived-tables.html), a table function requires an [alias](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/{{vers}}/en/identifiers.html) in the `SELECT` statement.

The result set is a single column with the predefined column name `value` of type `BIGINT UNSIGNED`. You can reference the `value` column in `SELECT` statements.

The following statements are valid:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> SELECT * FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(n) AS tt;
mysql> SELECT <expr(value)> FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(n) AS tt;
```

The first number in the series, the initial term, is defined as `0` and the series ends with a value less than `n`. In this example, enter the following statement to generate a sequence:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> SELECT * FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(3) AS tt;
```

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    +-------+
    | value |
    +-------+
    |     0 |
    |     1 |
    |     2 |
    +-------+
    ```

You can define the initial term using the `WHERE` clause. The following example starts the sequence with `4`.

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
SELECT value AS result FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(8) AS tt WHERE value >= 4;
```

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    +--------+
    | result |
    +--------+
    |      4 |
    |      5 |
    |      6 |
    |      7 |
    +--------+
    ```

Consecutive terms increase or decrease by a common difference. The default common difference value is `1`. However, it is possible to filter the results using the WHERE clause to simulate common differences greater than 1.

The following example prints only even numbers from the 0..7 range:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
SELECT value AS result FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(8) AS tt WHERE value % 2 = 0;
```

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    +--------+
    | result |
    +--------+
    |      0 |
    |      2 |
    |      4 |
    |      6 |
    +--------+
    ```

The following is an example of using the function to populate a table with a set of random numbers:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> SELECT FLOOR(RAND() * 100) AS result FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(4) AS tt;
```

The output could be the following:

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    +--------+
    | result |
    +--------+
    |     24 |
    |     56 |
    |     70 |
    |     25 |
    +--------+
    ```

You can populate a table with a set of pseudo-random strings with the following statement:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> SELECT MD5(value) AS result FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(4) AS tt;
```

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    +----------------------------------+
    | result                           |
    +----------------------------------+
    | f17d9c990f40f8ac215f2ecdfd7d0451 |
    | 2e5751b7cfd7f053cd29e946fb2649a4 |
    | b026324c6904b2a9cb4b88d6d61c81d1 |
    | 26ab0db90d72e28ad0ba1e22ee510510 |
    +----------------------------------+
    ```

You can add the sequence as a column to a new table or an existing table, as shown in this example:

```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
mysql> CREATE TABLE t1 AS SELECT * FROM SEQUENCE_TABLE(4) AS tt;

mysql> SELECT * FROM t1;
```

??? example "Expected output"

    ```{.text .no-copy}
    +-------+
    | value |
    +-------+
    |     0 |
    |     1 |
    |     2 |
    |     3 |
    +-------+
    ```

There are many uses for a sequence when populating tables.
