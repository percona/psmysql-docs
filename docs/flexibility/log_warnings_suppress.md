# Suppress Warning Messages

This feature is intended to provide a general mechanism (using `log_warnings_silence`) to disable certain warning messages to the log file. Currently, it is only implemented for disabling message #1592 warnings. This feature does not influence warnings delivered to a client. Please note that warning code needs to be a string:

```sql
mysql> SET GLOBAL log_warnings_suppress = '1592';
```
The output could be similar to the following:

```text
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
```

## Version Specific Information

* Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.10-1: Variable [log_warnings_suppress](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/5.7/flexibility/log_warnings_suppress.html?h=log_warnings_suppress) ported from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6.

* Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.11-4: Feature has been removed from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7 because MySQL 5.7.11 has implemented a new system variable, [log_statements_unsafe_for_binlog](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#sysvar_log_statements_unsafe_for_binlog), which implements the same effect.

## System Variables

### `innodb_ft_ignore_stopwords`

| Option       | Description              |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| Command-line | Yes                      |
| Config file  | Yes                      |
| Scope        | Global                   |
| Dynamic      | Yes                      |
| Data type    | SET                      |
| Default      |`(empty string)`          |
| Range        | `(empty string)`, `1592` |

It is intended to provide a more general mechanism for disabling warnings than existed previously with variable suppress_log_warning_1592.
When set to the empty string, no warnings are disabled. When set to `1592`, warning #1592 messages (unsafe statement for binary logging) are suppressed.
In the future, the ability to optionally disable additional warnings may also be added.
