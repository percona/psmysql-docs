# Use the keyring vault component

The `keyring_vault` component extends the server capabilities and provides an interface for the database with a [HashiCorp Vault] server to store key and secure encryption keys. 

--8<--- "keyring-components-installation.md"

The following example is a global manifest file that does not use local manifests:

```json
{
 "read_local_manifest": false,
 "components": "file:///component_keyring_vault"
}
```

The following is an example of a global manifest file that points to a local manifest file:

```json
{
 "read_local_manifest": true
}
```

The following is an example of a local manifest file:

```json
{
 "components": "file:///component_keyring_vault"
}
```

The configuration settings are either in a global configuration file or a local configuration file.

The `component_keyring_vault.cnf` file contains the following information:

* `read_local_config [optional]` - this option can be used only in the global configuration file. If you use this option, it indicats whether the component should read configuration information from the local configuration file. The allowed values are `true` or `false`. If you do not use this option, the component uses only the global configuration file.

    If you use the `read_local_config` option in the global configuration file along with other items, the component checks the `read_local_config` item value first:

    `false` - the component processes other items in the global configuration file and ignores the local configuration file.

    `true` - the component ignores other items in the global configuration file and attempts to read the local configuration file.

* `timeout` - the duration in seconds for the Vault server connection timeout. The default value is 15. The allowed range is from 0 to 86400. The timeout can be also disabled to wait an infinite amount of time by setting this variable to 0.

* `vault_url` - the Vault server address.

* `secret_mount_point` - the mount point name where the keyring_vault stores the keys.

* `token` - a token generated by the Vault server.

* `secret_mount_point_version [optional]` - the `KV Secrets Engine version (kv or kv-v2)` used. The allowed values are `AUTO`, `1`, and `2`. The default value is `AUTO`.

* `vault_ca [optional]` - if the machine does not trust the Vault’s CA certificate, this variable points to the CA certificate used to sign the Vault’s certificates.

??? example "Example of a configuration file in JSON format"

     ```json
     {
      "timeout": 15,
      "vault_url": "https://vault.public.com:8202",
      "secret_mount_point": "secret",
      "secret_mount_point_version": "AUTO",
      "token": "58a20c08-8001-fd5f-5192-7498a48eaf20",
      "vault_ca": "/data/keyring_vault_confs/vault_ca.crt"
     }
     ```

!!! warning

    Each `secret_mount_point` must be used by only one server. If multiple servers use the same `secret_mount_point`, the behavior is unpredictable.

The first time a key is fetched from a keyring, the `keyring_vault` communicates with the Vault server to retrieve the key type and data.

### secret_mount_point_version information

The `secret_mount_point_version` can be either a `1`, `2`, `AUTO`, or the `secret_mount_point_version` parameter is not listed in the configuration file.

| Value            | Description                                          |       
|----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1                | Works with `KV Secrets Engine - Version 1 (kv)`. When forming key operation URLs, the `secret_mount_point` is always used without any transformations. For example, to return a key named `skey`, the URL is <vault_url>/v1/<secret_mount_point>/skey  |
| 2                | Works with `KV Secrets Engine - Version 2 (kv)` The initialization logic splits the `secret_mount_point` parameter into two parts:<ul><li>The `mount_point_path` - the mount path under which the Vault Server secret was created</li><li>The `directory_path` - a virtual directory suffix that can be used to create virtual namespaces with the same real mount point</li></ul> For example, both the `mount_point_path` and the `directory_path` are needed to form key access URLs: <vault_url>/v1/<mount_point_path/data/<directory_path>/skey |
| AUTO | An autodetection mechanism probes and determines if the secrets engine version is `kv` or `kv-v2` and based on the outcome will either use the `secret_mount_point` as is, or split the `secret_mount_point` into two parts.|
| Not listed| If the `secret_mount_point_version` is not listed in the configuration file, the behavior is the same as `AUTO`.|

If you set the `secret_mount_point_version` to `2` but the path pointed by `secret_mount_point` is based on `KV Secrets Engine - Version 1 (kv)`, an error is reported and the component fails to initialize.

If you set the `secret_mount_point_version` to `1` but the path pointed by `secret_mount_point` is based on `KV Secrets Engine - Version 2 (kv-v2)`, the component initialization succeeds but any MySQL keyring-related operations fail.

### Upgrade from Vault Secrets Engine Version 1 to Version 2

You can upgrade from the Vault Secrets Engine Version 1 to Version 2.
    
Use either of the following methods:

* Set the `secret_mount_point_version` to `AUTO` or the variable is not set in the `keyring_vault` component configuration files in all Percona Servers. The `AUTO` value ensures the autodetection mechanism is invoked during the component initialization.

* Set the `secret_mount_point_version` to `2` to ensure that components do not initialize unless the `kv` to `kv-v2` upgrade completes.

!!! note

    The `keyring_vault` component that works with `kv-v2` secret engines does not use the built-in key versioning capabilities. The keyring key versions are encoded into key names.
