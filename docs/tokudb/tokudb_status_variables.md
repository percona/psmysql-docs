# TokuDB status variables

!!! important

    Starting with [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19](../release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.28-19.md), the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported. We have removed the storage engine from the installation packages and disabled the storage engine in our binary builds.

    Starting with [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.26-16](../release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.26-16.md), the binary builds and packages include but disable the TokuDB storage engine plugins. The tokudb_enabled option and the tokudb_backup_enabled option control the state of the plugins and have a default setting of FALSE. The result of attempting to load the plugins are the plugins fail to initialize and print a deprecation message.

    We recommend [Migrating the data to the MyRocks storage engine](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/latest/tokudb/removing_tokudb.html#migrate-myrocks). To enable the plugins to migrate to another storage engine, set the tokudb_enabled and tokudb_backup_enabled options to TRUE in your my.cnf file and restart your server instance. Then, you can load the plugins.

    The TokuDB storage engine was declared as deprecated in [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0](../release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.13-3.md). For more information, see the Percona blog post: [Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0](https://www.percona.com/blog/2021/05/21/tokudb-support-changes-and-future-removal-from-percona-server-for-mysql-8-0/).

*TokuDB* status variables provide details about the inner workings of *TokuDB*
storage engine and they can be useful in tuning the storage engine to a
particular environment.

You can view these variables and their values by running:

```sql
mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'tokudb%';
```

purpose due to layers of open/close caching on top.

### `Tokudb_DB_CLOSES`

This variable shows the number of times an individual PerconaFT dictionary file

currently in progress, then this time may be later than the time the last
checkpoint completed. If no checkpoint has ever taken place, then this value
will be `Dec 31, 1969` on Linux hosts.

this lock for a brief period.

### `Tokudb_CHECKPOINT_CLIENT_WAIT_ON_CS`

This variable shows the number of times a non-checkpoint client thread waited
for the checkpoint-safe lock. This is the lock taken when you `SET
tokudb_checkpoint_lock=1`. If a client trying to lock/postpone the

wait time will be reflected here and summed. This is not a useful metric as
regular users should never be manipulating the checkpoint lock.

evaluates to 1, the higher the cache pressure.

### `Tokudb_CACHETABLE_SIZE_CLONED`

serialization/compression, then written to disk. After which, the memory for

### `Tokudb_CACHETABLE_EVICTIONS`

This variable shows the number of blocks evicted from cache. On its own this is
not a useful number as its impact on performance depends entirely on the
hardware and workload in use. For example, two workloads, one random, one
