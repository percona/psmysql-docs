# TokuDB troubleshooting

!!! important

    Starting with [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19](../release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.28-19.md), the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported. We have removed the storage engine from the installation packages and disabled the storage engine in our binary builds.

    Starting with [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.26-16](../release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.26-16.md), the binary builds and packages include but disable the TokuDB storage engine plugins. The tokudb_enabled option and the tokudb_backup_enabled option control the state of the plugins and have a default setting of FALSE. The result of attempting to load the plugins are the plugins fail to initialize and print a deprecation message.

    We recommend [Migrating the data to the MyRocks storage engine](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server/latest/tokudb/removing_tokudb.html#migrate-myrocks). To enable the plugins to migrate to another storage engine, set the tokudb_enabled and tokudb_backup_enabled options to TRUE in your my.cnf file and restart your server instance. Then, you can load the plugins.

    The TokuDB storage engine was declared as deprecated in [Percona Server for MySQL 8.0](../release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.13-3.md). For more information, see the Percona blog post: [Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0](https://www.percona.com/blog/2021/05/21/tokudb-support-changes-and-future-removal-from-percona-server-for-mysql-8-0/).

## Known Issues

**Replication and binary logging**: *TokuDB* supports binary logging and replication, with one restriction. *TokuDB* does not implement a lock on the auto-increment function, so concurrent insert statements with one or more of the statements inserting multiple rows may result in a non-deterministic interleaving of the auto-increment values. When running replication with these concurrent inserts, the auto-increment values on the replica table may not match the auto-increment values on the source table. Note that this is only an issue with Statement Based Replication (SBR), and not Row Based Replication (RBR).

For more information about auto-increment and replication, see the *MySQL*
Reference Manual: [AUTO_INCREMENT handling in InnoDB](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/innodb-auto-increment-handling.html).

In addition, when using the `REPLACE INTO` or `INSERT IGNORE` on tables with no secondary indexes or tables where secondary indexes are subsets of the primary, the session variable tokudb_pk_insert_mode controls whether row based replication will work.

**Uninformative error message**: The `LOAD DATA INFILE` command can sometimes

    produce `ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 1 from storage engine`. The message
    should say that the error is caused by insufficient disk space for the
    temporary files created by the loader.

**Transparent Huge Pages**: *TokuDB* will refuse to start if transparent huge

    pages are enabled. Transparent huge page support can be disabled by issuing the
    following as root:

```shell
# echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled
```

[Lock](#lock-visualization-in-tokudb)
!!! note

    The previous command needs to be executed after every reboot, because it defaults to `always`.

**XA behavior vs. InnoDB**: *InnoDB* forces a deadlocked XA transaction to

    abort, *TokuDB* does not.

**Disabling the unique checks**: For tables with unique keys, every insertion
into the table causes a lookup by key followed by an insertion, if the key is
not in the table. This greatly limits insertion performance. If one knows by
design that the rows being inserted into the table have unique keys, then one
can disable the key lookup prior to insertion.

If your primary key is an auto-increment key, and none of your secondary keys
are declared to be unique, then setting `unique_checks=OFF` will provide
limited performance gains. On the other hand, if your primary key has a lot of
entropy (it looks random), or your secondary keys are declared unique and have
a lot of entropy, then disabling unique checks can provide a significant
performance boost.

If unique_checks is disabled when the primary key is not unique,
secondary indexes may become corrupted. In this case, the indexes should be
dropped and rebuilt. This behavior differs from that of *InnoDB*, in which
uniqueness is always checked on the primary key, and setting
unique_checks to off turns off uniqueness checking on secondary
indexes only. Turning off uniqueness checking on the primary key can provide
large performance boosts, but it should only be done when the primary key is
known to be unique.

**Group Replication**: *TokuDB* storage engine doesn’t support [Group Replication](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/group-replication.html).

As of 8.0.17, InnoDB supports [multi-valued indexes](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-index.html#create-index-multi-valued). TokuDB does not support this feature.

As of 8.0.17, InnoDB supports the [Clone Plugin](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/clone-plugin.html) and the Clone Plugin API. TokuDB tables do not support either of these features.

## Lock Visualization in TokuDB

*TokuDB* uses key range locks to implement serializable transactions, which are
acquired as the transaction progresses. The locks are released when the
transaction commits or aborts (this implements two phase locking).

*TokuDB* stores these locks in a data structure called the lock tree. The lock
tree stores the set of range locks granted to each transaction. In addition, the
lock tree stores the set of locks that are not granted due to a conflict with
locks granted to some other transaction. When these other transactions are
retired, these pending lock requests are retried. If a pending lock request is
not granted before the lock timer expires, then the lock request is aborted.

Lock visualization in *TokuDB* exposes the state of the lock tree with tables in
the information schema. We also provide a mechanism that may be used by a
database client to retrieve details about lock conflicts that it encountered
while executing a transaction.

### The `TOKUDB_TRX` table

The TOKUDB_TRX table in the `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` maps *TokuDB*
transaction identifiers to *MySQL* client identifiers. This mapping allows one
to associate a *TokuDB* transaction with a *MySQL* client operation.

The following query returns the *MySQL* clients that have a live *TokuDB*
transaction:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_TRX,
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST
WHERE trx_mysql_thread_id = id;
```

### The `TOKUDB_LOCKS` table

The tokudb_locks table in the information schema contains the set of
locks granted to *TokuDB* transactions.

The following query returns all of the locks granted to some *TokuDB*
transaction:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCKS;
```

The following query returns the locks granted to some *MySQL* client:

```sql
SELECT id FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCKS,
INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST
WHERE locks_mysql_thread_id = id;
```

### The `TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS` table

The tokudb_lock_waits table in the information schema contains the set
of lock requests that are not granted due to a lock conflict with some other
transaction.

The following query returns the locks that are waiting to be granted due to a
lock conflict with some other transaction:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS;
```

### Supporting explicit DEFAULT value expressions as of 8.0.13-3

TokuDB does not support [explicit DEFAULT value expressions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-type-defaults.html) as of verion 8.0.13-3.

### The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable

The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable controls how lock
timeouts and lock deadlocks seen by the database client are reported.

The following values are available:

* **0**

    No lock timeouts or lock deadlocks are reported.

* **1**

    A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is stored in the
    tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable

* **2**

    A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is printed to the *MySQL*
    error log.

    *Supported since 7.5.5*: In addition to the JSON document describing the lock conflict, the following lines are printed to the MySQL error log:

    * A line containing the blocked thread id and blocked SQL

    * A line containing the blocking thread id and the blocking SQL.

* **3**

    A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is stored in the tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable and is printed to the *MySQL* error log.

    *Supported since 7.5.5*: In addition to the JSON document describing the lock conflict, the following lines are printed to the *MySQL* error log:

    * A line containing the blocked thread id and blocked SQL

    * A line containing the blocking thread id and the blocking SQL.


### The tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable

The tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable contains a JSON
document that describes the last lock conflict seen by the current *MySQL*
client. It gets set when a blocked lock request times out or a lock deadlock is
detected. The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable should have
bit `0` set (decimal `1`).

### Example

Suppose that we create a table with a single column that is the primary key.

```sql
mysql> SHOW CREATE TABLE table;

Create Table: CREATE TABLE ‘table‘ (
‘id‘ int(11) NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY (‘id‘)) ENGINE=TokuDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1
```

Suppose that we have 2 *MySQL* clients with ID’s 1 and 2 respectively. Suppose
that *MySQL* client 1 inserts some values into `table`. *TokuDB* transaction
51 is created for the insert statement. Since autocommit is disabled,
transaction 51 is still live after the insert statement completes, and we can
query the tokudb_locks table in information schema to see the locks
that are held by the transaction.

```sql
mysql> SET AUTOCOMMIT=OFF;
mysql> INSERT INTO table VALUES (1),(10),(100);
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCKS;
```

```sql
mysql> SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS;
```

The keys are currently hex dumped.

Now we switch to the other *MySQL* client with ID 2.

```sql
mysql> INSERT INTO table VALUES (2),(20),(100);
```

The insert gets blocked since there is a conflict on the primary key with value 100.

The granted *TokuDB* locks are:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCKS;
```

The locks that are pending due to a conflict are:

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS;
```

THe output could be:

```text
+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+
| requesting_trx_id | blocking_trx_id | lock_waits_dname | lock_waits_key_left | lock_waits_key_right | lock_waits_start_time | locks_table_schema | locks_table_name | locks_table_dictionary_name |
+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+
|                62 |              51 | ./test/t-main    | 0064000000          | 0064000000           |         1380656990910 | test               | t                | main                        |
+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+
```

Eventually, the lock for client 2 times out, and we can retrieve a JSON document that describes the conflict.

```sql
SELECT @@TOKUDB_LAST_LOCK_TIMEOUT;
```

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```

Since transaction 62 was rolled back, all of the locks taken by it are released.

```sql
SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TOKUDB_LOCKS;
```

### Engine Status

Engine status provides details about the inner workings of *TokuDB* and can be
useful in tuning your particular environment. The engine status can be
determined by running the following command:  `SHOW ENGINE tokudb STATUS;`

The following is a reference of the table status statements:
