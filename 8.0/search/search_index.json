Submitting Changes \u00b6 We keep the trunk in a constant state of stability to allow for a release at any time and to minimize wasted time by developers due to broken code. Overview \u00b6 At Percona we use Git for source control, GitHub for code hosting, and Jira for release management. We change our software to implement new features and/or to fix bugs. Refactoring could be classed either as a new feature or a bug depending on the scope of work. New features and bugs are targeted to specific releases. A release is part of a series. For example, 2.4 is a series in Percona XtraBackup and 2.4.15, 2.4.16, and 2.4.17 are releases in this series. Code is proposed for merging in the form of pull requests on GitHub. For Percona Server for MySQL , we have several Git branches on which development occurs: 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, and 8.0. As Percona Server for MySQL is not a traditional project, instead of being a set of patches against an existing product, these branches are not related.

In this case, there should be two branches run through the param build and two merge proposals (one for the stable release and one with the changes merged to the trunk).

Stands for Atomicity , Consistency , Isolation , Durability . Atomicity \u00b6 Atomicity means that database operations are applied following a \u201call or nothing\u201d rule. A transaction is either fully applied or not at all. Consistency \u00b6 Consistency means that each transaction that modifies the database takes it from one consistent state to another. Durability \u00b6 Once a transaction is committed, it will remain so. Foreign Key \u00b6 A referential constraint between two tables. Example: A purchase order in the purchase_orders table must have been made by a customer that exists in the customers table. General Availability (GA) \u00b6 A finalized version of the product which is made available to the general public. It is the final stage in the software release cycle. Isolation \u00b6 The Isolation requirement means that no transaction can interfere with another. InnoDB \u00b6 A Storage Engine for MySQL and derivatives ( Percona Server , MariaDB ) originally written by Innobase Oy, since acquired by Oracle. It provides ACID compliant storage engine with foreign key support. As of MySQL version 5.5, InnoDB became the default storage engine on all platforms. Jenkins \u00b6 Jenkins is a continuous integration system that we use to help ensure the continued quality of the software we produce. It helps us achieve the aims of: no failed tests in the trunk on any platform aid developers in ensuring merge requests build and test on all platform no known performance regressions (without a damn good explanation). LSN \u00b6 The Log Sequence Number (LSN) is an 8-byte number. Every data change adds an entry to the redo log and generates an LSN. The server increments the LSN with every change. MariaDB \u00b6 A fork of MySQL that is maintained primarily by Monty Program AB. It aims to add features, and fix bugs while maintaining 100% backward compatibility with MySQL. my.cnf \u00b6 The file name of the default MySQL configuration file. MyISAM \u00b6 A MySQL Storage Engine that was the default until MySQL 5.5. MySQL \u00b6 An open source database that has spawned several distributions and forks. MySQL AB was the primary maintainer and distributor until bought by Sun Microsystems, which was then acquired by Oracle. As Oracle owns the MySQL trademark, the term MySQL is often used for the Oracle distribution of MySQL as distinct from the drop-in replacements such as MariaDB and Percona Server for MySQL . NUMA \u00b6 Non-Uniform Memory Access ( NUMA ) is a computer memory design used in multiprocessing, where the memory access time depends on the memory location relative to a processor. Under NUMA, a processor can access its own local memory faster than non-local memory, that is, memory local to another processor or memory shared between processors. The whole system may still operate as one unit, and all memory is basically accessible from everywhere but at a potentially higher latency and lower performance. Percona Server for MySQL \u00b6 The Percona branch of MySQL with performance and management improvements. Storage Engine \u00b6 A storage engine is a piece of software that implements the details of data storage and retrieval for a database system. This term is primarily used within the MySQL ecosystem due to it being the first widely used relational database to have an abstraction layer around storage. It is analogous to a Virtual File System layer in an Operating System. A VFS layer allows an operating system to read and write multiple file systems (e.g. FAT, NTFS, XFS, ext3) and a Storage Engine layer allows a database server to access tables stored in different engines (for example, MyISAM or InnoDB). Tech Preview \u00b6 A tech preview item can be a feature, a variable, or a value within a variable. The term designates that the item is not yet ready for production use and is not included in support by SLA. A tech preview item is included in a release so that users can provide feedback. The item is either updated and released as general availability(GA) or removed if not useful. The item\u2019s functionality can change from tech preview to GA. XtraDB \u00b6 The Percona improved version of InnoDB provides performance, features, and reliability above what is shipped by Oracle in InnoDB.","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary.html#glossary","text":"","title":"Glossary"},{"location":"glossary.html#acid","text":"Set of properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably.

Second , when Percona has released a product under a version of the GNU General Public License (\u201cGPL\u201d), you may use the appropriate Percona mark when distributing a verbatim copy of that product in accordance with the terms and conditions of the GPL. Third , you may use the appropriate Percona mark to refer to a distribution of GPL-released Percona software that has been modified with minor changes for the sole purpose of allowing the software to operate on an operating system or hardware platform for which Percona has not yet released the software, provided that those third party changes do not affect the behavior, functionality, features, design or performance of the software.

For example, if Percona believes that your modification is beyond the scope of the limited license granted in this Policy or that your use of the Percona mark is detrimental to Percona, Percona will revoke this authorization. Upon revocation, you must immediately cease using the applicable Percona mark. If you do not immediately cease using the Percona mark upon revocation, Percona may take action to protect its rights and interests in the Percona mark. Percona does not grant any license to use any Percona mark for any other modified versions of Percona software; such use will require our prior written permission. Neither trademark law nor any of the exceptions set forth in this Trademark Policy permit you to truncate, modify, or otherwise use any Percona mark as part of your own brand. For example, if XYZ creates a modified version of the Percona Server for MySQL , XYZ may not brand that modification as \u201cXYZ Percona Server\u201d or \u201cPercona XYZ Server\u201d, even if that modification otherwise complies with the third exception noted above. In all cases, you must comply with applicable law, the underlying license, and this Trademark Policy, as amended from time to time. For instance, any mention of Percona trademarks should include the full trademarked name, with proper spelling and capitalization, along with attribution of ownership to Percona Inc. For example, the full proper name for XtraBackup is Percona XtraBackup. However, it is acceptable to omit the word \u201cPercona\u201d for brevity on the second and subsequent uses, where such omission does not cause confusion.

For example, if Percona believes that your modification is beyond the scope of the limited license granted in this Policy or that your use of the Percona mark is detrimental to Percona, Percona will revoke this authorization. Upon revocation, you must immediately cease using the applicable Percona mark. If you do not immediately cease using the Percona mark upon revocation, Percona may take action to protect its rights and interests in the Percona mark. Percona does not grant any license to use any Percona mark for any other modified versions of Percona software; such use will require our prior written permission. Neither trademark law nor any of the exceptions set forth in this Trademark Policy permit you to truncate, modify, or otherwise use any Percona mark as part of your own brand. For example, if XYZ creates a modified version of the Percona Server for MySQL , XYZ may not brand that modification as \u201cXYZ Percona Server\u201d or \u201cPercona XYZ Server\u201d, even if that modification otherwise complies with the third exception noted above. In all cases, you must comply with applicable law, the underlying license, and this Trademark Policy, as amended from time to time. For instance, any mention of Percona trademarks should include the full trademarked name, with proper spelling and capitalization, along with attribution of ownership to Percona Inc. For example, the full proper name for XtraBackup is Percona XtraBackup. However, it is acceptable to omit the word \u201cPercona\u201d for brevity on the second and subsequent uses, where such omission does not cause confusion.

Download the packages of the desired series for your architecture from the download page . The easiest way is to download the bundle which contains all the packages. The following example will download Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.13-3 release packages for CentOS 7: $ wget https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-LATEST/Percona-Server-8.0.29-21/binary/redhat/8/x86_64/Percona-Server-8.0.29-21-rc59f87d2854-el8-x86_64-bundle.tar Unpack the bundle to get the packages $ tar xvf Percona-Server-8.0.29-21-rc59f87d2854-el8-x86_64-bundle.tar After you unpack the bundle, you should see the following packages: ls \\*.rpm Install Percona Server for MySQL : $ rpm -ivh percona-server-server-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ > percona-server-client-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ > percona-server-shared-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ > percona-server-shared-compat-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm This command will install only packages required to run the Percona Server for MySQL 8.0. Optionally you can install the TokuDB storage engine by adding the percona-server-tokudb-8.0.13-3.el7.x86_64.rpm to the command above. You can find more information on how to install and enable the TokuDB storage in the TokuDB Installation guide. You can install all the packages (for debugging, testing, etc.) with rpm -ivh \\*.rpm . Note When manually installing packages, you must resolve all the dependencies and install missing ones. Modify your configuration file, my.cnf , and install the plugins if necessary. If you are using the TokuDB storage engine you must comment out all the TokuDB specific variables in your configuration file(s) before starting the server, otherwise, the server will not start. RHEL / CentOS 7 automatically backs up the previous configuration file to /etc/my.cnf.rpmsave and installs the default my.cnf . After the upgrade/install process completes you can move the old configuration file back (after you remove all the unsupported system variables). As the schema of the grant table has changed, the server must be started without reading them with service mysql start .

Download the following packages for your architecture: percona-server-server percona-server-client percona-server-common libperconaserverclient21 The following example will download Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.29-21 release packages for Debian 11.0: ```shell $ wget https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-LATEST/Percona-Server-8.0.29-21/binary/debian/bullseye/x86_64/Percona-Server-8.0.29-21-rc59f87d2854-bullseye-x86_64-bundle.tar ``` Unpack the bundle to get the packages: tar xvf Percona-Server-8.0.29-21-rc59f87d2854-bullseye-x86_64-bundle.tar After you unpack the bundle, you should see the following packages: $ ls *.deb llibperconaserverclient21-dev_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-dbg_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb libperconaserverclient21_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-rocksdb_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-mysql-router_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-server_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-client_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-source_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-common_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb percona-server-test_8.0.29-21-1.bullseye_amd64.deb Install Percona Server for MySQL : $ sudo dpkg -i *.deb This will install all the packages from the bundle. Another option is to download/specify only the packages you need for running Percona Server for MySQL installation ( libperconaserverclient21_8.0.13-3.stretch_amd64.deb , percona-server-client-8.0.13-3.stretch_amd64.deb , percona-server-common-8.0.13-3.stretch_amd64.deb , and percona-server-server-8.0.13-3.stretch_amd64.deb . Optionally you can install percona-server-tokudb-8.0.13-3.stretch_amd64.deb if you want TokuDB storage engine). Warning When installing packages manually, you must resolve all the dependencies and install missing packages yourself. At least the following packages should be installed before installing Percona Server for MySQL 8.0: * libmecab2 , * libjemalloc1 , * zlib1g-dev , * libaio1 . Running the upgrade: Starting with Percona Server 8.0.16-7, the mysql_upgrade is deprecated. The functionality was moved to the mysqld binary which automatically runs the upgrade process, if needed. If you attempt to run mysql_upgrade, no operation happens and the following message appears: \u201cThe mysql_upgrade client is now deprecated. The actions executed by the upgrade client are now done by the server.\u201d To find more information, see MySQL Upgrade Process Upgrades If you are upgrading to a Percona Server for MySQL version before 8.0.16-7, the installation script will NOT run automatically mysql_upgrade . You must run the mysql_upgrade manually. $ mysql_upgrade Checking if update is needed. Checking server version. Running queries to upgrade MySQL server. Checking system database. mysql.columns_priv OK mysql.db OK mysql.engine_cost OK ... Upgrade process completed successfully. Checking if update is needed. Restart the service with service mysql restart . After the service has been successfully restarted you can use the new Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.","title":"DEB-based distributions"},{"location":"upgrading_using_standalone_packages.html#rpm-based-distributions","text":"Make a full backup (or dump if possible) of your database. Move the database configuration file, my.cnf , to another direction to save it. Stop the server with /etc/init.d/mysql stop . Check the installed packages: $ rpm -qa | grep percona-server The output could be similar to the following: percona-server-shared-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64 percona-server-shared-compat-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64 percona-server-client-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64 percona-server-server-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64 You may have the shared-compat package, which is required for compatibility. Remove the packages without dependencies with rpm -qa | grep percona-server | xargs rpm -e --nodeps . It is important that you remove the packages without dependencies as many packages may depend on these (as they replace mysql ) and will be removed if omitted. Substitute grep \u2018^mysql-\u2018 for grep \u2018Percona-Server\u2019 in the previous command and remove the listed packages. Download the packages of the desired series for your architecture from the download page . The easiest way is to download the bundle which contains all the packages. The following example will download Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.13-3 release packages for CentOS 7: $ wget https://downloads.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-LATEST/Percona-Server-8.0.29-21/binary/redhat/8/x86_64/Percona-Server-8.0.29-21-rc59f87d2854-el8-x86_64-bundle.tar Unpack the bundle to get the packages $ tar xvf Percona-Server-8.0.29-21-rc59f87d2854-el8-x86_64-bundle.tar After you unpack the bundle, you should see the following packages: ls \\*.rpm Install Percona Server for MySQL : $ rpm -ivh percona-server-server-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ > percona-server-client-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ > percona-server-shared-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm \\ > percona-server-shared-compat-8.0.29-21.1.el8.x86_64.rpm This command will install only packages required to run the Percona Server for MySQL 8.0. Optionally you can install the TokuDB storage engine by adding the percona-server-tokudb-8.0.13-3.el7.x86_64.rpm to the command above. You can find more information on how to install and enable the TokuDB storage in the TokuDB Installation guide. You can install all the packages (for debugging, testing, etc.) with rpm -ivh \\*.rpm . Note When manually installing packages, you must resolve all the dependencies and install missing ones. Modify your configuration file, my.cnf , and install the plugins if necessary. If you are using the TokuDB storage engine you must comment out all the TokuDB specific variables in your configuration file(s) before starting the server, otherwise, the server will not start. RHEL / CentOS 7 automatically backs up the previous configuration file to /etc/my.cnf.rpmsave and installs the default my.cnf . After the upgrade/install process completes you can move the old configuration file back (after you remove all the unsupported system variables). As the schema of the grant table has changed, the server must be started without reading them with service mysql start .

Other Information \u00b6 Author / Origin: Baron Schwartz, http://lists.mysql.com/internals/35174 System Variables \u00b6 innodb_show_locks_held \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type ULONG Default 10 Range 0 - 1000 Specifies the number of locks held to print for each InnoDB transaction in SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS . innodb_print_lock_wait_timeout_info \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF Makes InnoDB to write information about all lock wait timeout errors into the log file. This allows to find out details about the failed transaction, and, most importantly, the blocking transaction. Query string can be obtained from EVENTS_STATEMENTS_CURRENT table, based on the PROCESSLIST_ID field, which corresponds to thread_id from the log output. Taking into account that blocking transaction is often a multiple statement one, following query can be used to obtain blocking thread statements history: SELECT s . SQL_TEXT FROM performance_schema . events_statements_history s INNER JOIN performance_schema . threads t ON t . THREAD_ID = s . THREAD_ID WHERE t . PROCESSLIST_ID = % d UNION SELECT s . SQL_TEXT FROM performance_schema . events_statements_current s INNER JOIN performance_schema . threads t ON t . THREAD_ID = s . THREAD_ID WHERE t . PROCESSLIST_ID = % d ; The PROCESSLIST_ID in this example is exactly the thread id from error log output. Status Variables \u00b6 The status variables here contain information available in the output of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS , organized by the sections SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS displays. If you are familiar with the output of SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS , you will probably already recognize the information these variables contain. BACKGROUND THREAD \u00b6 The following variables contain information in the BACKGROUND THREAD section of the output from SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS . An example of that output is: ----------------- BACKGROUND THREAD ----------------- srv_master_thread loops: 1 srv_active, 0 srv_shutdown, 11844 srv_idle srv_master_thread log flush and writes: 11844 InnoDB has a source thread which performs background tasks depending on the server state, once per second. If the server is under workload, the source thread runs the following: performs background table drops; performs change buffer merge, adaptively; flushes the redo log to disk; evicts tables from the dictionary cache if needed to satisfy its size limit; makes a checkpoint. If the server is idle: performs background table drops, flushes and/or checkpoints the redo log if needed due to the checkpoint age; performs change buffer merge at full I/O capacity; evicts tables from the dictionary cache if needed; and makes a checkpoint.

You should test before putting this tool into production. A core dump file is the documented moment of a computer when either the computer or an application exits.

The libcoredumper is a free and Open Source fork of google-coredumper , enhanced to work on newer Linux versions, and GCC and CLANG. Enabling the libcoredumper \u00b6 Enable core dumps for troubleshooting purposes. To enable the libcoredumper , add the coredumper variable to the mysqld section of my.cnf . This variable is independent of the older core-file variable. The variable can have the following possible values: Value Description Blank The core dump is saved under MySQL datadir and named core. A path ending with / The core dump is saved under the specified directory and named core. Full path with a filename The core dump is saved under the specified directory and filename Restart the server. Verifying the libcoredumper is Active \u00b6 MySQL writes to the log when generating a core file and delegates the core dump operation to the Linux kernel. An example of the log message is the following: Writing a core file MySQL using the libcoredumper to generate the file creates the following message in the log: Writing a core file using lib coredumper Every core file adds a crash timestamp instead of a PID for the following reasons: Correlates the core file with the crash. MySQL prints a UTC timestamp on the crash log. 10:02:09 UTC - mysqld got signal 11; Stores multiple core files. Note For example, operators and containers run as the process id of PID 1. If the process ID is used to identify the core file, each container crash generates a core dump that overwrites the previous core file. Disabling the libcoredumper \u00b6 You can disable the libcoredumper. A core file may contain sensitive data and takes disk space. To disable the libcoredumper you must do the following: In the mysqld section of my.cnf, remove the libcoredumper variable.

Developers examine the dump as one of the tasks when searching for the cause of a failure. The libcoredumper is a free and Open Source fork of google-coredumper , enhanced to work on newer Linux versions, and GCC and CLANG.","title":"Using libcoredumper"},{"location":"diagnostics/libcoredumper.html#enabling-the-libcoredumper","text":"Enable core dumps for troubleshooting purposes.

It lets you enable or disable the slow query log at runtime, adds logging for the replica SQL thread, and adds fine-grained control over what and how much to log into the slow query log. You can use Percona-Toolkit \u2019s pt-query-digest tool to aggregate similar queries together and report on those that consume the most execution time. Version Specific Information \u00b6 8.0.12-1: The feature was ported from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7. System Variables \u00b6 log_slow_filter \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global, Session Dynamic Yes Filters the slow log by the query\u2019s execution plan. The value is a comma-delimited string, and can contain any combination of the following values: full_scan : The query performed a full table scan. full_join : The query performed a full join (a join without indexes). tmp_table : The query created an implicit internal temporary table. tmp_table_on_disk : The query\u2019s temporary table was stored on disk. filesort : The query used a filesort. filesort_on_disk : The filesort was performed on disk. Values are OR\u2019ed together. If the string is empty, then the filter is disabled. If it is not empty, then queries will only be logged to the slow log if their execution plan matches one of the types of plans present in the filter. For example, to log only queries that perform a full table scan, set the value to full_scan . To log only queries that use on-disk temporary storage for intermediate results, set the value to tmp_table_on_disk,filesort_on_disk . log_slow_rate_type \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic yes Data type Enumerated Default session, query Specifies semantic of log_slow_rate_limit - session or query . log_slow_rate_limit \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global, session Dynamic yes Default 1 Range 1-1000 Behavior of this variable depends on the selected log_slow_rate_type. Specifies that only a fraction of session/query should be logged. Logging is enabled for every nth session/query . By default, n is 1, so logging is enabled for every session/query . Please note: when log_slow_rate_type is session rate limiting is disabled for the replication thread. Logging all queries might consume I/O bandwidth and cause the log file to grow large. * When log_slow_rate_type is `session`, this option lets you log full sessions, so you have complete records of sessions for later analysis; but you can rate-limit the number of sessions that are logged. Note that this feature will not work well if your application uses any type of connection pooling or persistent connections. Note that you change log_slow_rate_limit in `session` mode, you should reconnect for get effect. * When log_slow_rate_type is `query`, this option lets you log just some queries for later analysis. For example, if you set the value to 100, then one percent of queries will be logged. Note that every query has global unique query_id and every connection can has it own (session) log_slow_rate_limit. Decision \u201clog or no\u201d calculated in following manner: if log_slow_rate_limit is 1 - log every query If log_slow_rate_limit 1 - randomly log every 1/ log_slow_rate_limit query. This allows flexible setup logging behavior. For example, if you set the value to 100, then one percent of sessions/queries will be logged. In Percona Server for MySQL information about the log_slow_rate_limit has been added to the slow query log. This means that if the log_slow_rate_limit is effective it will be reflected in the slow query log for each written query. Example of the output looks like this: Log_slow_rate_type: query Log_slow_rate_limit: 10 log_slow_sp_statements \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Enumerated Default session Range session, query If TRUE , statements executed by stored procedures are logged to the slow if it is open. Percona Server for MySQL implemented improvements for logging of stored procedures to the slow query log: * Each query from a stored procedure is now logged to the slow query log individually * `CALL` itself isn\u2019t logged to the slow query log anymore as this would be counting twice for the same query which would lead to incorrect results * Queries that were called inside of stored procedures are annotated in the slow query log with the stored procedure name in which they run. Example of the improved stored procedure slow query log entry: mysqlDELIMITER // mysqlCREATE PROCEDURE improved_sp_log () BEGIN SELECT * FROM City ; SELECT * FROM Country ; END // mysqlDELIMITER ; mysqlCALL improved_sp_log (); When we check the slow query log after running the stored procedure, with log_slow_sp_statements set to TRUE , it should look like this: # Time: 150109 11:38:55 # User@Host: root[root] @ localhost [] # Thread_id: 40 Schema: world Last_errno: 0 Killed: 0 # Query_time: 0.012989 Lock_time: 0.000033 Rows_sent: 4079 Rows_examined: 4079 Rows_affected: 0 Rows_read: 4079 # Bytes_sent: 161085 # Stored routine: world.improved_sp_log SET timestamp=1420803535; SELECT * FROM City; # User@Host: root[root] @ localhost [] # Thread_id: 40 Schema: world Last_errno: 0 Killed: 0 # Query_time: 0.001413 Lock_time: 0.000017 Rows_sent: 4318 Rows_examined: 4318 Rows_affected: 0 Rows_read: 4318 # Bytes_sent: 194601 # Stored routine: world.improved_sp_log SET timestamp=1420803535; If variable log_slow_sp_statements is set to FALSE : Entry is added to a slow-log for a CALL statement only and not for any of the individual statements run in that stored procedure Execution time is reported for the CALL statement as the total execution time of the CALL including all its statements If we run the same stored procedure with the log_slow_sp_statements is set to FALSE slow query log should look like this: # Time: 150109 11:51:42 # User@Host: root[root] @ localhost [] # Thread_id: 40 Schema: world Last_errno: 0 Killed: 0 # Query_time: 0.013947 Lock_time: 0.000000 Rows_sent: 4318 Rows_examined: 4318 Rows_affected: 0 Rows_read: 4318 # Bytes_sent: 194612 SET timestamp=1420804302; CALL improved_sp_log(); Note Support for logging stored procedures doesn\u2019t involve triggers, so they won\u2019t be logged even if this feature is enabled. log_slow_verbosity \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global, session Dynamic Yes Specifies how much information to include in your slow log. The value is a comma-delimited string, and can contain any combination of the following values: microtime : Log queries with microsecond precision. query_plan : Log information about the query\u2019s execution plan. innodb : Log InnoDB statistics. minimal : Equivalent to enabling just microtime . standard : Equivalent to enabling microtime,query_plan . full : Equivalent to all other values OR\u2019ed together without the profiling and profiling_use_getrusage options. profiling : Enables profiling of all queries in all connections. profiling_use_getrusage : Enables usage of the getrusage function. query_info : Enables printing Query_tables and Query_digest into the slow query log. These fields are disabled by default. Values are OR\u2019ed together. For example, to enable microsecond query timing and InnoDB statistics, set this option to microtime,innodb or standard . To turn all options on, set the option to full . slow_query_log_use_global_control \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Default None Specifies which variables have global scope instead of local. For such variables, the global variable value is used in the current session, but without copying this value to the session value. Value is a \u201cflag\u201d variable - you can specify multiple values separated by commas none : All variables use local scope log_slow_filter : Global variable log_slow_filter has effect (instead of local) log_slow_rate_limit : Global variable log_slow_rate_limit has effect (instead of local) log_slow_verbosity : Global variable log_slow_verbosity has effect (instead of local) long_query_time : Global variable long_query_time has effect (instead of local) min_examined_row_limit : Global variable min_examined_row_limit has effect (instead of local) all Global variables has effect (instead of local) slow_query_log_always_write_time \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Default 10 This variable can be used to specify the query execution time after which the query will be written to the slow query log. It can be used to specify an additional execution time threshold for the slow query log, that, when exceeded, will cause a query to be logged unconditionally, that is, log_slow_rate_limit will not apply to it. Other Information \u00b6 Changes to the Log Format \u00b6 The feature adds more information to the slow log output.

If the query was killed, the ``Killed:` keyword is followed by a number other than zero: Killed Numeric Code Exception 0 NOT_KILLED 1 KILL_BAD_DATA 1053 ER_SERVER_SHUTDOWN (see MySQL Documentation) 1317 ER_QUERY_INTERRUPTED (see MySQL Documentation) 3024 ER_QUERY_TIMEOUT (see MySQL Documentation) Any other number KILLED_NO_VALUE (Catches all other cases) Connection and Schema Identifier \u00b6 Each slow log entry now contains a connection identifier, so you can trace all the queries coming from a single connection. This is the same value that is shown in the Id column in SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST or returned from the CONNECTION_ID() function. Each entry also contains a schema name, so you can trace all the queries whose default database was set to a particular schema. # Id: 43 Schema: imdb Microsecond Time Resolution and Extra Row Information \u00b6 This is the original functionality offered by the microslow feature. Query_time and Lock_time are logged with microsecond resolution. The feature also adds information about how many rows were examined for SELECT queries, and how many were analyzed and affected for UPDATE , DELETE , and INSERT queries, # Query_time: 0.962742 Lock_time: 0.000202 Rows_sent: 4 Rows_examined: 1543719 Rows_affected: 0 Values and context: Rows_examined : Number of rows scanned - SELECT Rows_affected : Number of rows changed - UPDATE , DELETE , INSERT Memory Footprint \u00b6 The feature provides information about the amount of bytes sent for the result of the query and the number of temporary tables created for its execution - differentiated by whether they were created on memory or on disk - with the total number of bytes used by them. # Bytes_sent: 8053 Tmp_tables: 1 Tmp_disk_tables: 0 Tmp_table_sizes: 950528 Values and context: Bytes_sent : The amount of bytes sent for the result of the query Tmp_tables : Number of temporary tables created on memory for the query Tmp_disk_tables : Number of temporary tables created on disk for the query Tmp_table_sizes : Total Size in bytes for all temporary tables used in the query Query Plan Information \u00b6 Each query can be executed in various ways. For example, it may use indexes or do a full table scan, or a temporary table may be needed. These are the things that you can usually see by running EXPLAIN on the query. The feature will now allow you to see the most important facts about the execution in the log file. # Full_scan: Yes Full_join: No Tmp_table: No Tmp_table_on_disk: No # Filesort: No Filesort_on_disk: No Merge_passes: 0 The values and their meanings are documented with the log_slow_filter option. InnoDB Usage Information \u00b6 The final part of the output is the InnoDB usage statistics. MySQL currently shows many per-session statistics for operations with SHOW SESSION STATUS , but that does not include those of InnoDB , which are always global and shared by all threads. This feature lets you see those values for a given query. # InnoDB_IO_r_ops: 6415 InnoDB_IO_r_bytes: 105103360 InnoDB_IO_r_wait: 0.001279 # InnoDB_rec_lock_wait: 0.000000 InnoDB_queue_wait: 0.000000 # InnoDB_pages_distinct: 6430 Values: innodb_IO_r_ops : Counts the number of page read operations scheduled. The actual number of read operations may be different, but since this can be done asynchronously, there is no good way to measure it. innodb_IO_r_bytes : Similar to innodb_IO_r_ops, but the unit is bytes. innodb_IO_r_wait : Shows how long (in seconds) it took InnoDB to actually read the data from storage. innodb_rec_lock_wait : Shows how long (in seconds) the query waited for row locks. innodb_queue_wait : Shows how long (in seconds) the query spent either waiting to enter the InnoDB queue or inside that queue waiting for execution. innodb_pages_distinct : Counts approximately the number of unique pages the query accessed. The approximation is based on a small hash array representing the entire buffer pool, because it could take a lot of memory to map all the pages. The inaccuracy grows with the number of pages accessed by a query, because there is a higher probability of hash collisions. If the query did not use InnoDB tables, that information is written into the log instead of the above statistics.

Please note: when log_slow_rate_type is session rate limiting is disabled for the replication thread. Logging all queries might consume I/O bandwidth and cause the log file to grow large. * When log_slow_rate_type is `session`, this option lets you log full sessions, so you have complete records of sessions for later analysis; but you can rate-limit the number of sessions that are logged. Note that this feature will not work well if your application uses any type of connection pooling or persistent connections. Note that you change log_slow_rate_limit in `session` mode, you should reconnect for get effect. * When log_slow_rate_type is `query`, this option lets you log just some queries for later analysis. For example, if you set the value to 100, then one percent of queries will be logged. Note that every query has global unique query_id and every connection can has it own (session) log_slow_rate_limit. Decision \u201clog or no\u201d calculated in following manner: if log_slow_rate_limit is 1 - log every query If log_slow_rate_limit 1 - randomly log every 1/ log_slow_rate_limit query. This allows flexible setup logging behavior. For example, if you set the value to 100, then one percent of sessions/queries will be logged. In Percona Server for MySQL information about the log_slow_rate_limit has been added to the slow query log. This means that if the log_slow_rate_limit is effective it will be reflected in the slow query log for each written query.

This resulted in replication specifics, which distinguishes it from MySQL . Safety of statements with a LIMIT clause \u00b6 Summary of the Fix \u00b6 MySQL considers all UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT ... SELECT statements with LIMIT clause to be unsafe, no matter wether they are really producing non-deterministic result or not, and switches from statement-based logging to row-based one. Percona Server for MySQL is more accurate, it acknowledges such instructions as safe when they include ORDER BY PK or WHERE condition. This fix has been ported from the upstream bug report #42415 ( #44 ). Performance improvement on relay log position update \u00b6 Relay log position fix \u00b6 MySQL always updated relay log position in multi-source replications setups regardless of whether the committed transaction has already been executed or not. Percona Server omits relay log position updates for the already logged GTIDs. Relay log position details \u00b6 Particularly, such unconditional relay log position updates caused additional fsync operations in case of relay-log-info-repository=TABLE , and with the higher number of channels transmitting such duplicate (already executed) transactions the situation became proportionally worse. Bug fixed #1786 (upstream #85141 ). Performance improvement on source and connection status updates \u00b6 Source and connection status update fix \u00b6 Replica nodes configured to update source status and connection information only on log file rotation did not experience the expected reduction in load. MySQL was additionally updating this information in case of multi-source replication when replica had to skip the already executed GTID event. Source and connection status details \u00b6 The configuration with master_info_repository=TABLE and sync_master_info=0 makes replica to update source status and connection information in this table on log file rotation and not after each sync_master_info event, but it didn\u2019t work on multi-source replication setups. Heartbeats sent to the replica to skip GTID events which it had already executed previously, were evaluated as relay log rotation events and reacted with mysql.slave_master_info table sync. This inaccuracy could produce huge (up to 5 times on some setups) increase in write load on the replica, before this problem was fixed in Percona Server for MySQL . Bug fixed #1812 (upstream #85158 ). Writing FLUSH Commands to the Binary Log \u00b6 FLUSH commands, such as FLUSH SLOW LOGS , are not written to the binary log if the system variable binlog_skip_flush_commands is set to ON . In addition, the following changes were implemented in the behavior of read_only and super_read_only modes: When read_only is set to ON , any FLUSH ... command executed by a normal user (without the SUPER privilege) are not written to the binary log regardless of the value of the binlog_skip_flush_command variable. When super_read_only is set to ON , any FLUSH ... command executed by any user (even by those with the SUPER privilege) are not written to the binary log regardless of the value of the binlog_skip_flush_commands variable. An attempt to run a FLUSH command without either SUPER or RELOAD privileges results in the ER_SPECIFIC_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR exception regardless of the value of the binlog_skip_flush_commands variable. binlog_skip_flush_commands \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Default OFF This variable was introduced in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.15-5. When binlog_skip_flush_commands is set to ON , FLUSH ... commands are not written to the binary log. See Writing FLUSH Commands to the Binary Log for more information about what else affects the writing of FLUSH commands to the binary log. Note FLUSH LOGS , FLUSH BINARY LOGS , FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK , and FLUSH TABLES ... FOR EXPORT are not written to the binary log no matter what value the binlog_skip_flush_commands variable contains. The FLUSH command is not recorded to the binary log and the value of binlog_skip_flush_commands is ignored if the FLUSH command is run with the NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG keyword (or its alias LOCAL ). Maintaining Comments with DROP TABLE \u00b6 When you issue a DROP TABLE command, the binary log stores the command but removes comments and encloses the table name in quotation marks. If you require the binary log to maintain the comments and not add quotation marks, enable binlog_ddl_skip_rewrite . binlog_ddl_skip_rewrite \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Default OFF This variable was introduced in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.26-16. If the variable is enabled, single table DROP TABLE DDL statements are logged in the binary log with comments. Multi-table DROP TABLE DDL statements are not supported and return an error. SET binlog_ddl_skip_rewrite = ON ; /*comment at start*/ DROP TABLE t /*comment at end*/ ; Binary Log User Defined Functions \u00b6 To implement Point in Time recovery, we have added the binlog_utils_udf . The following user-defined functions are included: Name Returns Description get_binlog_by_gtid() Binlog file name as STRING Returns the binlog file name that contains the specified GTID get_last_gtid_from_binlog() GTID as STRING Returns the last GTID found in the specified binlog get_gtid_set_by_binlog() GTID set as STRING Returns all GTIDs found in the specified binlog get_binlog_by_gtid_set() Binlog file name as STRING Returns the file name of the binlog which contains at least one GTID from the specified set. get_first_record_timestamp_by_binlog() Timestamp as INTEGER Returns the timestamp of the first event in the specified binlog get_last_record_timestamp_by_binlog() Timestamp as INTEGER Returns the timestamp of the last event in the specified binlog Note All functions returning timestamps return their values as microsecond precision UNIX time. In other words, they represent the number of microseconds since 1-JAN-1970. All functions accepting a binlog name as the parameter accepts only short names, without a path component. If the path separator (\u2018/\u2019) is found in the input, an error is returned. This serves the purpose of restricting the locations from where binlogs can be read. They are always read from the current binlog directory ( @@log_bin_basename system variable ). All functions returning binlog file names return the name in short form, without a path component.

For all other purposes, the data type is identical to the one without the modifier, i.e. no new data types are created. Compression is done by using the zlib library. Additionally, it is possible to pre-define a set of strings for each compressed column to achieve a better compression ratio on relatively small individual data items. This feature provides: a better compression ratio for text data which consists of a large number of predefined words (e.g. JSON or XML) using compression methods with static dictionaries a way to select columns in the table to compress (in contrast to the InnoDB row compression method). This feature is based on a patch provided by Weixiang Zhai. Specifications \u00b6 The feature is limited to InnoDB/XtraDB storage engine and to columns of the following data types: BLOB (including TINYBLOB , MEDIUMBLOB , LONGBLOG ) TEXT (including TINYTEXT , MEDUUMTEXT , LONGTEXT ) VARCHAR (including NATIONAL VARCHAR ) VARBINARY JSON A compressed column is declared by using the syntax that extends the existing COLUMN_FORMAT modifier: COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED . If this modifier is applied to an unsupported column type or storage engine, an error is returned. The compression can be specified: when creating a table: CREATE TABLE ... (..., foo BLOB COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED, ...); when altering a table and modifying a column to the compressed format: ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY [COLUMN] ... COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED , or ALTER TABLE ... CHANGE [COLUMN] ... COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED . Unlike Oracle MySQL, compression is applicable to generated stored columns. Use this syntax extension as follows: mysql > CREATE TABLE t1 ( id INT , a BLOB , b JSON COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED , g BLOB GENERATED ALWAYS AS ( a ) STORED COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED WITH COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY numbers ) ENGINE = InnoDB ; To decompress a column, specify a value other than COMPRESSED to COLUMN_FORMAT : FIXED , DYNAMIC , or DEFAULT . If there is a column compression/decompression request in an ALTER TABLE , it is forced to the COPY algorithm. Two new variables: innodb_compressed_columns_zip_level and innodb_compressed_columns_threshold have been implemented. Compression dictionary support \u00b6 To achieve a better compression ratio on relatively small individual data items, it is possible to predefine a compression dictionary, which is a set of strings for each compressed column. Compression dictionaries can be represented as a list of words in the form of a string (a comma or any other character can be used as a delimiter although not required). In other words, a, bb, ccc , a bb ccc , and abbccc will have the same effect. However, the latter is more compact. The Quote symbol quoting is handled by regular SQL quoting. The maximum supported dictionary length is 32506 bytes ( zlib limitation). The compression dictionary is stored in a new system InnoDB table. As this table is of the data dictionary kind, concurrent reads are allowed, but writes are serialized, and reads are blocked by writes. Table read through old read views are not supported, similar to InnoDB internal DDL transactions. Interaction with innodb_force_recovery variable \u00b6 Compression dictionary operations are treated like DDL operations with the exception when innodb_force_value is set to 3 : with values less than 3 , compression dictionary operations are allowed, and with values >= 3 , they are forbidden. Note Prior to Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.15-6 using Compression dictionary operations with innodb_force_recovery variable set to value > 0 would result in an error. Example \u00b6 In order to use the compression dictionary, you need to create it. This can be done by running: mysql > SET @ dictionary_data = 'one' 'two' 'three' 'four' ; The output should look like this: Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) mysql > CREATE COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY numbers ( @ dictionary_data ); The output should look like this: Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec) To create a table that has both compression and compressed dictionary support you should run: mysql > CREATE TABLE t1 ( id INT , a BLOB COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED , b BLOB COLUMN_FORMAT COMPRESSED WITH COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY numbers ) ENGINE = InnoDB ; The following example shows how to insert a sample of JSON data into the table: SET @jso n _value = ' [ \\ n ' ' { \\ n ' ' \"one\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"two\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"three\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"four\" = 0 \\ n ' ' }, \\ n ' ' { \\ n ' ' \"one\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"two\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"three\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"four\" = 0 \\ n ' ' }, \\ n ' ' { \\ n ' ' \"one\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"two\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"three\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"four\" = 0 \\ n ' ' }, \\ n ' ' { \\ n ' ' \"one\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"two\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"three\" = 0 , \\ n ' ' \"four\" = 0 \\ n ' ' } \\ n ' ' ] \\ n ' ; mysql> INSERT INTO t1 VALUES(0, @json_value, @json_value); Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec) INFORMATION_SCHEMA Tables \u00b6 This feature implements two new INFORMATION_SCHEMA tables.

Note CREATE TABLE t2 AS SELECT \\* FROM t1 will create a new table with a compressed column, whereas CREATE TABLE t2 AS SELECT CONCAT(a,'') AS a FROM t1 will not create compressed columns. At the same time, after executing the CREATE TABLE t2 LIKE t1 statement, t2.a will have the COMPRESSED attribute. ALTER TABLE ... DISCARD/IMPORT TABLESPACE is not supported for tables with compressed columns. To export and import tablespaces with compressed columns, you uncompress them first with: ALTER TABLE ... MODIFY ...

When a new enable-compressed-columns-with-dictionaries option is specified, dump will contain all compressed column attributes and compression dictionary.

By default, add-drop-compression-dictionary the mode will be used. When both enable-compressed-columns-with-dictionaries and --tab=<dir> (separate file for each table) options are specified, necessary compression dictionaries will be created in each output file using the following fragment (regardless of the values of add-drop-compression-dictionary and skip-add-drop-compression-dictionary options). /*!50633 CREATE COMPRESSION_DICTIONARY IF NOT EXISTS <dictionary>(...); */ Version Specific Information \u00b6 Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.13-3: The feature was ported from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.

The fixed row format imposes restrictions on the type of columns as it assigns in advance a limited amount of memory per row. This renders a VARCHAR field in a CHAR field in practice and makes it impossible to have a TEXT or BLOB field with that engine implementation. To overcome this limitation, the Improved MEMORY Storage Engine is introduced in this release for supporting true VARCHAR , VARBINARY , TEXT , and BLOB fields in the MEMORY tables. This implementation is based on the Dynamic Row Format ( DFR ) introduced by the mysql-heap-dynamic-rows patch. DFR is used to store column values in a variable-length form, thus helping to decrease the memory footprint of those columns and making possible BLOB and TEXT fields and real VARCHAR and VARBINARY . Unlike the fixed implementation, each column value in DRF uses only as much space as required. Variable-length values can use up to 4 bytes to store the actual value length, and only the necessary number of blocks is used to store the value. Rows in DFR are represented internally by multiple memory blocks, which means that a single row can consist of multiple blocks organized into one set. Each row occupies at least one block, there can not be multiple rows within a single block. Block size can be configured when creating a table (see below). This DFR implementation has two caveats regarding ordering and indexes. Caveats \u00b6 Ordering of Rows \u00b6 In the absence of ORDER BY , records may be returned in a different order than the previous MEMORY implementation. This is not a bug. Any application relying on a specific order without an ORDER BY clause may deliver unexpected results. A specific order without ORDER BY is a side effect of a storage engine and query optimizer implementation which may and will change between minor MySQL releases. Indexing \u00b6 It is currently impossible to use indexes on BLOB columns due to some limitations of the Dynamic Row Format . Trying to create such an index will fail with the following error: BLOB column '<name>' can't be used in key specification with the used table type. Restrictions \u00b6 For performance reasons, a mixed solution is implemented: the fixed format is used at the beginning of the row, while the dynamic one is used for the rest of it. The size of the fixed-format portion of the record is chosen automatically on CREATE TABLE and cannot be changed later. This, in particular, means that no indexes can be created later with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE when the dynamic row format is used. All values for columns used in indexes are stored in fixed format at the first block of the row, then the following columns are handled with DRF . This sets two restrictions to tables: * the order of the fields and therefore, * the minimum size of the block used in the table. Ordering of Columns \u00b6 The columns used in fixed format must be defined before the dynamic ones in the CREATE TABLE statement. If this requirement is not met, the engine will not be able to add blocks to the set for these fields and they will be treated as fixed. Minimum Block Size \u00b6 The block size has to be big enough to store all fixed-length information in the first block. If not, the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements will fail (see below). Limitations \u00b6 MyISAM tables are still used for query optimizer internal temporary tables where the MEMORY tables could be used now instead: for temporary tables containing large VARCHAR\\ `s, ``BLOB , and TEXT` columns. Setting Row Format \u00b6 Taking the restrictions into account, the Improved MEMORY Storage Engine will choose DRF over FRF at the moment of creating the table according to following criteria: * There is an implicit request of the user in the column types **OR** * There is an explicit request of the user **AND** the overhead incurred by `DFR` is beneficial. Implicit Request \u00b6 The implicit request by the user is taken when there is at least one BLOB or TEXT column in the table definition. If there are none of these columns and no relevant option is given, the engine will choose FRF . For example, this will yield the use of the dynamic format: mysql > CREATE TABLE t1 ( f1 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f2 TEXT , PRIMARY KEY ( f1 )) ENGINE = HEAP ; While this will not: mysql > CREATE TABLE t1 ( f1 VARCHAR ( 16 ), f2 VARCHAR ( 16 ), PRIMARY KEY ( f1 )) ENGINE = HEAP ; Explicit Request \u00b6 The explicit request is set with one of the following options in the CREATE TABLE statement: * `KEY_BLOCK_SIZE = <value>` * Requests the DFR with the specified block size (in bytes) Despite its name, the KEY_BLOCK_SIZE option refers to a block size used to store data rather then indexes. The reason for this is that an existing CREATE TABLE option is reused to avoid introducing new ones. The Improved MEMORY Engine checks whether the specified block size is large enough to keep all key column values. If it is too small, table creation will abort with an error. After DRF is requested explicitly and there are no BLOB or TEXT columns in the table definition, the Improved MEMORY Engine will check if using the dynamic format provides any space saving benefits as compared to the fixed one: * if the fixed row length is less than the dynamic block size (plus the dynamic row overhead - platform dependent) **OR** * there isn\u2019t any variable-length columns in the table or `VARCHAR` fields are declared with length 31 or less, the engine will revert to the fixed format as it is more space efficient in such case. The row format being used by the engine can be checked using SHOW TABLE STATUS . Examples \u00b6 On a 32-bit platform: mysql > CREATE TABLE t1 ( f1 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f2 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f3 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f4 VARCHAR ( 32 ), PRIMARY KEY ( f1 )) KEY_BLOCK_SIZE = 124 ENGINE = HEAP ; mysql > SHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 't1' ; The output could be the following: Name Engine Version Rows Avg_row_length Data_length Max_data_length Index_length Data_free Auto_increment Create_time Update_time Check_time Collation Checksum Create_options Comment t1 MEMORY 10 X 0 X 0 0 NULL NULL NULL NULL latin1_swedish_ci NULL row_format=DYNAMIC KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=124 On a 64-bit platform: mysqlCREATE TABLE t1 ( f1 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f2 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f3 VARCHAR ( 32 ), f4 VARCHAR ( 32 ), PRIMARY KEY ( f1 )) KEY_BLOCK_SIZE = 124 ENGINE = HEAP ; mysqlSHOW TABLE STATUS LIKE 't1' ; The output could be the following: Name Engine Version Rows Avg_row_length Data_length Max_data_length Index_length Data_free Auto_increment Create_time Update_time Check_time Collation Checksum Create_options Comment t1 MEMORY 10 X 0 X 0 0 NULL NULL NULL NULL latin1_swedish_ci NULL KEY_BLOCK_SIZE=124 Implementation Details \u00b6 MySQL MEMORY tables keep data in arrays of fixed-size chunks. These chunks are organized into two groups of HP_BLOCK structures: group1 contains indexes, with one HP_BLOCK per key (part of HP_KEYDEF ), group2 contains record data, with a single HP_BLOCK for all records. While columns used in indexes are usually small, other columns in the table may need to accommodate larger data. Typically, larger data is placed into VARCHAR or BLOB columns. The Improved MEMORY Engine implements the concept of dataspace, HP_DATASPACE , which incorporates the HP_BLOCK structures for the record data, adding more information for managing variable-sized records. Variable-size records are stored in multiple \u201cchunks\u201d, which means that a single record of data (a database \u201crow\u201d) can consist of multiple chunks organized into one \u201cset\u201d, contained in HP_BLOCK structures. In variable-size format, one record is represented as one or many chunks depending on the actual data, while in fixed-size mode, one record is always represented as one chunk. The index structures would always point to the first chunk in the chunkset. Variable-size records are necessary only in the presence of variable-size columns. The Improved Memory Engine will be looking for BLOB or VARCHAR columns with a declared length of 32 or more. If no such columns are found, the table will be switched to the fixed-size format. You should always put such columns at the end of the table definition in order to use the variable-size format. Whenever data is being inserted or updated in the table, the Improved Memory Engine will calculate how many chunks are necessary. For INSERT operations, the engine only allocates new chunksets in the recordspace. For UPDATE operations it will modify the length of the existing chunkset if necessary, unlinking unnecessary chunks at the end, or allocating and adding more if a larger length is needed. When writing data to chunks or copying data back to a record, fixed-size columns are copied in their full format, while VARCHAR and BLOB columns are copied based on their actual length, skipping any NULL values. When allocating a new chunkset of N chunks, the engine will try to allocate chunks one-by-one, linking them as they become allocated. For allocating a single chunk, it will attempt to reuse a deleted (freed) chunk. If no free chunks are available, it will try to allocate a new area inside a HP_BLOCK . When freeing chunks, the engine will place them at the front of a free list in the dataspace, each one containing a reference to the previously freed chunk. The allocation and contents of the actual chunks varies between fixed and variable-size modes: Format of a fixed-size chunk: uchar[] * With sizeof=chunk_dataspace_length , but at least sizeof(uchar\\*) bytes. It keeps actual data or pointer to the next deleted chunk, where chunk_dataspace_length equals to full record length uchar * Status field (1 means \u201cin use\u201d, 0 means \u201cdeleted\u201d) Format of a variable-size chunk: uchar[] * With sizeof=chunk_dataspace_length , but at least sizeof(uchar\\*) bytes. It keeps actual data or pointer to the next deleted chunk, where chunk_dataspace_length is set according to table\u2019s key_block_size uchar\\* * Pointer to the next chunk in this chunkset, or NULL for the last chunk uchar * Status field (1 means \u201cfirst\u201d, 0 means \u201cdeleted\u201d, 2 means \u201clinked\u201d) Total chunk length is always aligned to the next sizeof(uchar\\*) .

To avoid scalability problems, each thread-handling query has its own table instance. The server uses a special cache, called the Table Cache, which contains open table instanances. The use of the cache avoids paying the penalty in resources for opening and closing tables for each statement. The [table_open_cache ](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_table_open_cache) system variable sets soft limits on the cache size.

The table_open_cache_instances system variable shows the number of open tables cache instances. For more information, see How MySQL opens and closes tables . Opening a table with triggers in Table Cache also parses the trigger definitions and associates the open table instance with its own instances of the defined trigger bodies. When a connection executes a DML statement and must run a trigger, that connection gets its own instance of the trigger body for that specific open table instance.

Type '\\c' to clear the current input statement. mysql> Accessing the server from an application in another container \u00b6 The image exposes the standard MySQL port 3306, so container linking makes the Percona Server instance available from other containers. To link a container running your application (in this case, from an image named app/image ) with the Percona Server container, run it with the following command: [ root@docker-host ] $ docker run -d \\ --name app \\ --link ps \\ app/image:latest This application container will be able to access the Percona Server container via port 3306. Storing data \u00b6 There are two ways to store data used by applications that run in Docker containers: Let Docker manage the storage of your data by writing the database files to disk on the host system using its internal volume management. Create a data directory on the host system on high-performance storage and mount it to a directory visible from the container. This method places the database files in a known location on the host system, and makes it easy for tools and applications on the host system to access the files. The user should ensure that the directory exists, that the user accounts have required permissions, and that any other security mechanisms on the host system are set up correctly. For example, if you create a data directory on a suitable volume on your host system named /local/datadir , you run the container with the following command: [ root@docker-host ] $ docker run -d \\ --name ps \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = root \\ -v /local/datadir:/var/lib/mysql \\ percona/percona-server:8.0 The -v /local/datadir:/var/lib/mysql option mounts the /local/datadir directory on the host to /var/lib/mysql in the container, which is the default data directory used by Percona Server for MySQL . Do not add MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD to the docker run command if the data directory contains subdirectories, files, or data. Note If you have SELinux enabled, assign the relevant policy type to the new data directory so that the container will be allowed to access it: [root@docker-host] $ chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t /local/datadir Port forwarding \u00b6 Docker allows mapping ports on the container to ports on the host system using the -p option. If you run the container with this option, you can connect to the database by connecting your client to a port on the host machine. This ability simplifies consolidating instances to a single host. To map the standard MySQL port 3306 to port 6603 on the host: [ root@docker-host ] $ docker run -d \\ --name ps \\ -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD = root \\ -p 6603 :3306 \\ percona/percona-server:8.0 Exiting the container \u00b6 If you are in the interactive shell, use CTRL-D or exit to exit the session. If you have a non-shell process running, interrupt the process with CTRL-C before using either CTRL-D or exit. Stopping the container \u00b6 The docker stop container command sends a TERM signal, then waits 10 seconds and sends a KILL signal. The following example stops the ps container: $ docker stop ps The default length of time before stopping a container is 10 seconds. A very large instance cannot dump the data from memory to disk within that time. With this type of instance, add the --time or the -t option to docker stop: $ docker stop ps -t 600 Removing the container \u00b6 To remove a stopped container, use the docker rm command. $ docker rm ps For more information \u00b6 Review the Docker Docs","title":"Running Percona Server for MySQL in a Docker Container"},{"location":"installation/docker.html#running-percona-server-for-mysql-in-a-docker-container","text":"Percona Server for MySQL has an official Docker image hosted on Docker Hub .

Audit Connect or Disconnect Query Audit event indicates that audit logging started or finished. NAME field will be Audit when logging started and NoAudit when logging finished. Audit record also includes server version and command-line arguments. ??? example \"Audit event\" ```text <AUDIT_RECORD NAME=\"Audit\" RECORD=\"1_2021-06-30T11:56:53\" TIMESTAMP=\"2021-06-30T11:56:53 UTC\" MYSQL_VERSION=\"5.7.34-37\" STARTUP_OPTIONS=\"--daemonize --pid-file=/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.pid\" OS_VERSION=\"x86_64-debian-linux-gnu\" /> ``` Connect record event will have NAME field Connect when user logged in or login failed, or Quit when connection is closed. The additional fields for this event are the following: * `CONNECTION_ID` * `STATUS` * `USER` * `PRIV_USER` * `OS_LOGIN` * `PROXY_USER` * `HOST` * `IP` The value for STATUS is 0 for successful logins and non-zero for failed logins. Disconnect event <AUDIT_RECORD NAME=\"Quit\" RECORD=\"5_2021-06-29T19:33:03\" TIMESTAMP=\"2021-06-29T19:34:38Z\" CONNECTION_ID=\"14\" STATUS=\"0\" USER=\"root\" PRIV_USER=\"root\" OS_LOGIN=\"\" PROXY_USER=\"\" HOST=\"localhost\" IP=\"\" DB=\"\" /> Additional fields for this event are: COMMAND_CLASS (values come from the com_status_vars array in the `sql/mysqld.cc`` file in a MySQL source distribution. Examples are select , alter_table , create_table , etc.), CONNECTION_ID , STATUS (indicates an error when the vaule is non-zero), SQLTEXT (text of SQL-statement), USER , HOST , OS_USER , IP . The possible values for the NAME name field for this event are Query , Prepare , Execute , Change user , etc. Query event <AUDIT_RECORD NAME=\"Query\" RECORD=\"4_2021-06-29T19:33:03\" TIMESTAMP=\"2021-06-29T19:33:34Z\" COMMAND_CLASS=\"show_variables\" CONNECTION_ID=\"14\" STATUS=\"0\" SQLTEXT=\"show variables like 'audit%'\" USER=\"root[root] @ localhost []\" HOST=\"localhost\" OS_USER=\"\" IP=\"\" DB=\"\" /> Stream the audit log to syslog \u00b6 To stream the audit log to syslog you\u2019ll need to set audit_log_handler variable to SYSLOG . To control the syslog file handler, the following variables can be used: audit_log_syslog_ident, audit_log_syslog_facility, and audit_log_syslog_priority These variables have the same meaning as appropriate parameters described in the syslog(3) manual . Note The actions for the variables: audit_log_strategy, audit_log_buffer_size, audit_log_rotate_on_size, audit_log_rotations are captured only with FILE handler. Filter methods \u00b6 You can filter the results by the following methods. Filter by user Filter by SQL command type Filtering by database The filtering by user feature adds two new global variables: audit_log_include_accounts and audit_log_exclude_accounts to specify which user accounts should be included or excluded from audit logging. Only one of these variables can contain a list of users to be either included or excluded, while the other must be NULL . If one of the variables is set to be not NULL (contains a list of users), the attempt to set another one fails. An empty string means an empty list. Changes of audit_log_include_accounts and audit_log_exclude_accounts do not apply to existing server connections. The filtering by SQL command type adds two new global variables: audit_log_include_commands and audit_log_exclude_commands to specify which command types should be included or excluded from audit logging. Only one of these variables can contain a list of command types to be either included or excluded, while the other needs to be NULL . If one of the variables is set to be not NULL (contains a list of command types), the attempt to set another one will fail. An empty string is defined as an empty list. If both the audit_log_exclude_commands variable and the audit_log_include_commands variable are NULL , all commands are logged. The filtering by an SQL database is implemented by two global variables: audit_log_include_databases and audit_log_exclude_databases to specify which databases should be included or excluded from audit logging.

Note As of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.13-4, LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP requires the BACKUP_ADMIN privilege. LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP \u00b6 LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP uses a new MDL lock type to block updates to non-transactional tables and DDL statements for all tables. If there is an active LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP lock then all DDL statements and all updates to MyISAM, CSV, MEMORY, ARCHIVE, TokuDB , and MyRocks tables will be blocked in the Waiting for backup lock status, visible in PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA or PROCESSLIST . LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP has no effect on SELECT queries for all mentioned storage engines. Against InnoDB , MyRocks , Blackhole and Federated tables, the LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP is not applicable to the INSERT , REPLACE , UPDATE , DELETE statements: Blackhole tables obviously have no relevance to backups, and Federated tables are ignored by both logical and physical backup tools. Unlike FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK , LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP does not flush tables, i.e. storage engines are not forced to close tables and tables are not expelled from the table cache. As a result, LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP only waits for conflicting statements to complete (i.e. DDL and updates to non-transactional tables). It never waits for SELECTs, or UPDATEs to InnoDB or MyRocks tables to complete, for example. If an \u201cunsafe\u201d statement is executed in the same connection that is holding a LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP lock, it fails with the following error: ERROR 1880 (HY000): Can't execute the query because you have a conflicting backup lock UNLOCK TABLES releases the lock acquired by LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP. The intended use case for Percona XtraBackup is: LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP ... copy .frm, MyISAM, CSV, etc. ... UNLOCK TABLES ... get binlog coordinates ... ... wait for redo log copying to finish ... Privileges \u00b6 The LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP requires the BACKUP_ADMIN privilege. Interaction with other global locks \u00b6 The LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP has no effect if the current connection already owns a FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK lock, as it is a more restrictive lock. If FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK is executed in a connection that has acquired LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP , FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK fails with an error. If the server is operating in the read-only mode (i.e. read_only set to 1 ), statements that are unsafe for backups will be either blocked or fail with an error, depending on whether they are executed in the same connection that owns LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP lock, or other connections. MyISAM index and data buffering \u00b6 MyISAM key buffering is normally write-through, i.e. by the time each update to a MyISAM table is completed, all index updates are written to disk. The only exception is delayed key writing feature which is disabled by default. When the global system variable delay_key_write is set to ALL , key buffers for all MyISAM tables are not flushed between updates, so a physical backup of those tables may result in broken MyISAM indexes. To prevent this, LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP will fail with an error if delay_key_write is set to ALL . An attempt to set delay_key_write to ALL when there\u2019s an active backup lock will also fail with an error. Another option to involve delayed key writing is to create MyISAM tables with the DELAY_KEY_WRITE option and set the delay_key_write variable to ON (which is the default). In this case, LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP will not be able to prevent stale index files from appearing in the backup. Users are encouraged to set delay_key_writes to OFF in the configuration file, my.cnf , or repair MyISAM indexes after restoring from a physical backup created with backup locks. MyISAM may also cache data for bulk inserts, e.g. when executing multi-row INSERTs or LOAD DATA statements. Those caches, however, are flushed between statements, so have no effect on physical backups as long as all statements updating MyISAM tables are blocked. The mysqldump Command \u00b6 mysqldump has also been extended with a new option, lock-for-backup (disabled by default). When used together with the --single-transaction option, the option makes mysqldump issue LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP before starting the dump operation to prevent unsafe statements that would normally result in an inconsistent backup. When used without the --single-transaction option, lock-for-backup is automatically converted to lock-all-tables. The option lock-for-backup is mutually exclusive with lock-all-tables , i.e. specifying both on the command line will lead to an error. If the backup locks feature is not supported by the target server, but lock-for-backup is specified on the command line, mysqldump aborts with an error.

For more information, see MySQL InnoDB Clone and page tracking . XtraDB now tracks the pages that have changes written to them according to the redo log. This information is written out in special changed page bitmap files. This information can be used to speed up incremental backups using Percona XtraBackup by removing the need to scan whole data files to find the changed pages. Changed page tracking is done by a new XtraDB worker thread that reads and parses log records between checkpoints.

Percona has implemented several changes related to MySQL \u2019s fast index creation feature. Fast index creation was implemented in MySQL as a way to speed up the process of adding or dropping indexes on tables with many rows. This feature implements a session variable that enables extended fast index creation. Besides optimizing DDL directly, expand_fast_index_creation may also optimize index access for subsequent DML statements because using it results in much less fragmented indexes. The mysqldump Command \u00b6 A new option, --innodb-optimize-keys , was implemented in mysqldump . It changes the way InnoDB tables are dumped, so that secondary and foreign keys are created after loading the data, thus taking advantage of fast index creation. More specifically: KEY , UNIQUE KEY , and CONSTRAINT clauses are omitted from CREATE TABLE statements corresponding to InnoDB tables. An additional ALTER TABLE is issued after dumping the data, in order to create the previously omitted keys. ALTER TABLE \u00b6 When ALTER TABLE requires a table copy, secondary keys are now dropped and recreated later, after copying the data. The following restrictions apply: Only non-unique keys can be involved in this optimization. If the table contains foreign keys, or a foreign key is being added as a part of the current ALTER TABLE statement, the optimization is disabled for all keys. OPTIMIZE TABLE \u00b6 Internally, OPTIMIZE TABLE is mapped to ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=innodb for InnoDB tables. As a consequence, it now also benefits from fast index creation, with the same restrictions as for ALTER TABLE . Caveats \u00b6 InnoDB fast index creation uses temporary files in tmpdir for all indexes being created. So make sure you have enough tmpdir space when using expand_fast_index_creation . It is a session variable, so you can temporarily switch it off if you are short on tmpdir space and/or don\u2019t want this optimization to be used for a specific table. There\u2019s also a number of cases when this optimization is not applicable: UNIQUE indexes in ALTER TABLE are ignored to enforce uniqueness where necessary when copying the data to a temporary table; ALTER TABLE and OPTIMIZE TABLE always process tables containing foreign keys as if expand_fast_index_creation is OFF to avoid dropping keys that are part of a FOREIGN KEY constraint; mysqldump --innodb-optimize-keys ignores foreign keys because InnoDB requires a full table rebuild on foreign key changes.

This feature is especially useful to those operating MySQL As A Service. This user has a mixed and special scope of abilities and protection: Utility user does not appear in the mysql.user table and can not be modified by any other user, including root. Utility user does not appear in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.USER_STATISTICS , INFORMATION_SCHEMA.CLIENT_STATISTICS or THREAD_STATISTICS tables or in any performance_schema tables . Utility user\u2019s queries may appear in the general and slow logs. Utility user does not have the ability create, modify, delete or see any schemas or data not specified, except for information_schema. Utility user may modify all visible, non-read-only system variables (see expanded_option_modifiers functionality). Utility user may see, create, modify and delete other system users only if given access to the mysql schema. Regular users may be granted proxy rights to the utility user but attempts to impersonate the utility user fail. The utility user may not be granted proxy rights on any regular user. For example, GRANT PROXY ON utility_user TO regular_user; does not fail, but any actual attempt to impersonate as the utility user fails. GRANT PROXY ON regular_user TO utility_user; fails when utility_user is an exact match or is more specific than than the utility user specified. At server start, the server notes in the log output that the utility user exists and the schemas that the utility user can access. Version Specific Information \u00b6 The utility_user_dynamic_privileges variable was implemented in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.20-11 . Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.17-8 : The feature was ported from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7. System Variables \u00b6 In order to have the ability for a special type of MySQL user, which will have a very limited and special amount of control over the system and can not be see or modified by any other user including the root user, three new options have been added. utility_user \u00b6 Option Description Command Line: Yes Config file utility_user=< user@host > Scope: Global Dynamic: No Data type String Default NULL Specifies a MySQL user that will be added to the internal list of users and recognized as the utility user. Option utility_user specifies the user which the system creates and recognizes as the utility user. The host in the utility user specification follows conventions described in the MySQL manual . For example, the conventions allow wildcards and IP masks. Anonymous user names are not permitted to be used for the utility user name. This user must not be an exact match to any other user that exists in the mysql.user table. If the server detects that the user specified with this option exactly matches any user within the mysql.user table on start up, the server reports an error and exits gracefully. If host name wildcards are used and a more specific user specification is identified on start up, the server reports a warning and continues.

The default column family is the location for the indexes created by the user when you a column family is not explicitly specified.

MyRocks has a couple of special session variables to speed up data loading dramatically. Sorted bulk loading \u00b6 If your data is guaranteed to be loaded in primary key order, then this method is recommended. This method works by dropping any secondary keys first, loading data into your table in primary key order, and then restoring the secondary keys via Fast Secondary Index Creation. Creating Secondary Indexes \u00b6 When loading data into empty tables, it is highly recommended to drop all secondary indexes first, then loading data, and adding all secondary indexes after finishing loading data. MyRocks has a feature called Fast Secondary Index Creation . Fast Secondary Index Creation is automatically used when executing CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE ... ADD INDEX . With Fast Secondary Index Creation, the secondary index entries are directly written to bottommost RocksDB levels and bypassing compaction. This significantly reduces total write volume and CPU time for decompressing and compressing data on higher levels. Loading Data \u00b6 As described above, loading data is highly recommended for tables with primary key only (no secondary keys), with all secondary indexes added after loading data. When loading data into MyRocks tables, there are two recommended session variables: SET session sql_log_bin = 0 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 1 ; When converting from large MyISAM/InnoDB tables, either by using the ALTER or INSERT INTO SELECT statements it\u2019s recommended that you create MyRocks tables as below (in case the table is sufficiently big it will cause the server to consume all the memory and then be terminated by the OOM killer): SET session sql_log_bin = 0 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 1 ; ALTER TABLE large_myisam_table ENGINE = RocksDB ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 0 ; Using sql_log_bin=0 avoids writing to binary logs. With rocksdb_bulk_load set to 1 , MyRocks enters special mode to write all inserts into bottommost RocksDB levels, and skips writing data into MemTable and the following compactions. This is very efficient way to load data. The rocksdb_bulk_load mode operates with a few conditions: None of the data being bulk loaded can overlap with existing data in the table. The easiest way to ensure this is to always bulk load into an empty table, but the mode will allow loading some data into the table, doing other operations, and then returning and bulk loading addition data if there is no overlap between what is being loaded and what already exists. The data may not be visible until bulk load mode is ended (i.e. the rocksdb_bulk_load is set to zero again). The method that is used is building up SST files which will later be added as-is to the database. Until a particular SST has been added the data will not be visible to the rest of the system, thus issuing a SELECT on the table currently being bulk loaded will only show older data and will likely not show the most recently added rows. Ending the bulk load mode will cause the most recent SST file to be added. When bulk loading multiple tables, starting a new table will trigger the code to add the most recent SST file to the system \u2013 as a result, it is inadvisable to interleave INSERT statements to two or more tables during bulk load mode. By default, the rocksdb_bulk_load mode expects all data be inserted in primary key order (or reversed order). If the data is in the reverse order (i.e. the data is descending on a normally ordered primary key or is ascending on a reverse ordered primary key), the rows are cached in chunks to switch the order to match the expected order. Inserting one or more rows out of order will result in an error and may result in some of the data being inserted in the table and some not. To resolve the problem, one can either fix the data order of the insert, truncate the table, and restart. Unsorted bulk loading \u00b6 If your data is not ordered in primary key order, then this method is recommended. With this method, secondary keys do not need to be dropped and restored. However, writing to the primary key no longer goes directly to SST files, and are written to temporary files for sorted first, so there is extra cost to this method. To allow for loading unsorted data: SET session sql_log_bin = 0 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load_allow_unsorted = 1 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 1 ; ... SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 0 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load_allow_unsorted = 0 ; Note that rocksdb_bulk_load_allow_unsorted can only be changed when rocksdb_bulk_load is disabled (set to 0 ). In this case, all input data will go through an intermediate step that writes the rows to temporary SST files, sorts them rows in the primary key order, and then writes to final SST files in the correct order. Other Approaches \u00b6 If rocksdb_commit_in_the_middle is enabled, MyRocks implicitly commits every rocksdb_bulk_load_size records (default is 1,000 ) in the middle of your transaction. If your data loading fails in the middle of the statement ( LOAD DATA or bulk INSERT ), rows are not entirely rolled back, but some of rows are stored in the table. To restart data loading, you\u2019ll need to truncate the table and loading data again. Warning If you are loading large data without enabling rocksdb_bulk_load or rocksdb_commit_in_the_middle , please make sure transaction size is small enough.

By default, MyRocks prevents creating indexes with non-binary collations (including latin1 ). You can optionally use it by setting rocksdb_strict_collation_exceptions to t1 (table names with regex format), but non-binary covering indexes other than latin1 (excluding german1 ) still require a primary key lookup to return the CHAR or VARCHAR column. Either ORDER BY DESC or ORDER BY ASC is slow. This is because of \u201cPrefix Key Encoding\u201d feature in RocksDB. See http://www.slideshare.net/matsunobu/myrocks-deep-dive/58 for details. By default, ascending scan is faster and descending scan is slower. If the \u201creverse column family\u201d is configured, then descending scan will be faster and ascending scan will be slower. Note that InnoDB also imposes a cost when the index is scanned in the opposite order. When converting from large MyISAM/InnoDB tables, either by using the ALTER or INSERT INTO SELECT statements it\u2019s recommended that you check the Data loading documentation and create MyRocks tables as below (in case the table is sufficiently big it will cause the server to consume all the memory and then be terminated by the OOM killer): SET session sql_log_bin = 0 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 1 ; ALTER TABLE large_myisam_table ENGINE = RocksDB ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 0 ; .. warning:: If you are loading large data without enabling :ref:`rocksdb_bulk_load` or :ref:`rocksdb_commit_in_the_middle`, please make sure transaction size is small enough. All modifications of the ongoing transactions are kept in memory. With partitioned tables that use the TokuDB or MyRocks storage engine, the upgrade only works with native partitioning. See also MySQL Documentation: Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 and Unicode 9.0.0 standards have defined a change in the handling of binary collations. These collations are handled as NO PAD, trailing spaces are included in key comparisons. A binary collation comparison may result in two unique rows inserted and does not generate a`DUP_ENTRY` error. MyRocks key encoding and comparison does not account for this character set attribute. Not Supported on MyRocks \u00b6 MyRocks does not support the following: Operating as either a source or a replica in any replication topology that is not exclusively row-based. Statement-based and mixed-format binary logging is not supported. For more information, see Replication Formats . Using multi-valued indexes . Implemented in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB supports this feature. Using spatial data types . Using the Clone Plugin and the Clone Plugin API. As of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB supports either these features. Using encryption in tables. At this time, during an ALTER TABLE operation, MyRocks mistakenly detects all InnoDB tables as encrypted. Therefore, any attempt to ALTER an InnoDB table to MyRocks fails. As a workaround, we recommend a manual move of the table. The following steps are the same as the ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=... process: Use SHOW CREATE TABLE ... to return the InnoDB table definition. With the table definition as the source, perform a CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE=RocksDB . In the new table, use INSERT INTO <new table> SELECT \\* FROM <old table> . Note With MyRocks and with large tables, it is recommended to set the session variable rocksdb_bulk_load=1 during the load to prevent running out of memory.

Either ORDER BY DESC or ORDER BY ASC is slow. This is because of \u201cPrefix Key Encoding\u201d feature in RocksDB. See http://www.slideshare.net/matsunobu/myrocks-deep-dive/58 for details. By default, ascending scan is faster and descending scan is slower. If the \u201creverse column family\u201d is configured, then descending scan will be faster and ascending scan will be slower. Note that InnoDB also imposes a cost when the index is scanned in the opposite order. When converting from large MyISAM/InnoDB tables, either by using the ALTER or INSERT INTO SELECT statements it\u2019s recommended that you check the Data loading documentation and create MyRocks tables as below (in case the table is sufficiently big it will cause the server to consume all the memory and then be terminated by the OOM killer): SET session sql_log_bin = 0 ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 1 ; ALTER TABLE large_myisam_table ENGINE = RocksDB ; SET session rocksdb_bulk_load = 0 ; .. warning:: If you are loading large data without enabling :ref:`rocksdb_bulk_load` or :ref:`rocksdb_commit_in_the_middle`, please make sure transaction size is small enough. All modifications of the ongoing transactions are kept in memory. With partitioned tables that use the TokuDB or MyRocks storage engine, the upgrade only works with native partitioning. See also MySQL Documentation: Preparing Your Installation for Upgrade Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 and Unicode 9.0.0 standards have defined a change in the handling of binary collations. These collations are handled as NO PAD, trailing spaces are included in key comparisons. A binary collation comparison may result in two unique rows inserted and does not generate a`DUP_ENTRY` error. MyRocks key encoding and comparison does not account for this character set attribute.","title":"MyRocks Limitations"},{"location":"myrocks/limitations.html#not-supported-on-myrocks","text":"MyRocks does not support the following: Operating as either a source or a replica in any replication topology that is not exclusively row-based. Statement-based and mixed-format binary logging is not supported. For more information, see Replication Formats . Using multi-valued indexes .

As of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.17, InnoDB supports either these features. Using encryption in tables. At this time, during an ALTER TABLE operation, MyRocks mistakenly detects all InnoDB tables as encrypted. Therefore, any attempt to ALTER an InnoDB table to MyRocks fails. As a workaround, we recommend a manual move of the table. The following steps are the same as the ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=... process: Use SHOW CREATE TABLE ... to return the InnoDB table definition. With the table definition as the source, perform a CREATE TABLE ... ENGINE=RocksDB . In the new table, use INSERT INTO <new table> SELECT \\* FROM <old table> . Note With MyRocks and with large tables, it is recommended to set the session variable rocksdb_bulk_load=1 during the load to prevent running out of memory. This recommendation is because of the MyRocks large transaction limitation.

There several ways to set these variables: For production deployments, you should have all variables defined in the configuration file. Dynamic variables can be changed at runtime using the SET statement. If you want to test things out, you can set some of the variables when starting mysqld using corresponding command-line options. If a variable was not set in either the configuration file or as a command-line option, the default value is used. Also, all variables can exist in one or both of the following scopes: Global scope defines how the variable affects overall server operation. Session scope defines how the variable affects operation for individual client connections.

Disabled by default. Once corruption is detected server writes marker file (named ROCKSDB_CORRUPTED) in the data directory and aborts. If marker file exists, then mysqld exits on startup with an error message. The restart failure will continue until the problem is solved or until mysqld is started with this variable turned on in the command line. Note Not all memtables support concurrent writes. rocksdb_allow_mmap_reads \u00b6 Option Description Command-line --rocksdb-allow-mmap-reads Dynamic No Scope Global Data type Boolean Default OFF Specifies whether to allow the OS to map a data file into memory for reads. Disabled by default.

A solid state drive (SSD) does not overwrite data like a magnetic hard disk drive. Data must be written to an empty page. An SSD issue is write amplification . This issue is when the same data is written multiple times. An SSD is organized in pages and blocks. Data is written in pages and erased in blocks. If, for example, you have 8KB data on a page. The application updates one sector (512 Bytes) of that page. The controller reads the page in RAM, marks the old page as stale , updates the sector, and then writes a new page with this 8KB of data. The process is efficient use of the storage space but also shortens the SSD lifespan because the SSD parts do wear out. Garbage collection can also cause large-scale write amplification. The stale data is erased in blocks, which can consist of hundreds of pages. The SSD controller searches for pages that are marked stale. Pages that are not stale but are stored in that block are moved to another block before the block is erased and marked ready for use. The zone storage model organizes the SSD into a set of zones that are uniform in size and uses the Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) technology. ZNS is optimized for an SSD and exposes this zoned block storage interface between the host and SSD. ZNS enables smart data placement. Writes are sequential within a zone. ZenFS is a file system plugin for RocksDB which uses the RocksDB file system to place files into zones on a raw zoned block device (ZBD). The plugin adds native support for ZNS, avoids on device garbage collection, and minimizes write amplification. File data is stored in a set of extents. Within a zone, extents are a contiguous part of the address space. Garbage collection is an option, but this selection can cause write amplification. ZenFS depends on the libzbd user library and requires a Linux kernel implementation that supports NVMe Zoned Namespaces. The kernel must be configured with zone block device support enabled . Read the Western Digital and Percona deliver Utrastar DC ZN540 Zoned Namespace SSD support for Percona Server for MySQL PDF for more information. The following procedure installs Percona Server for MySQL and then configures --rocksdb-fs-uri=zenfs://dev:<short_block_device_name> for data storage. Note The can have a short name designation which is the . For example, if the is /dev/nvme0n2 remove the /dev/ portion and the is nvme0n2 . The block device name and short block device name must be substituted with the appropriate name from your system. To indicate that such a substitution is needed in statements, we use and . For the moment, the ZenFS plugin can be enabled in following distributions: Distribution Name Notes Debian 11.1 Able to run the ZenFS plugin Ubuntu 20.04.3 Requires the 5.11 HWE kernel patched with the allow blk-zoned ioctls without CAPT_SYS_ADMIN patch If the ZenFS functionality is not enabled on Ubuntu 20.04, the binaries with ZenFS support can run on the standard 5.4 kernel. Other Linux distributions are adding support for ZenFS, but Percona does not provide installation packages for those distributions. Installation \u00b6 Start with the installation of Percona Server for MySQL . The steps are listed here for convenience, for an explanation, see Installing Percona Server for MySQL from Percona apt repository . $ wget https://repo.percona.com/apt/percona-release_latest. $( lsb_release -sc ) _all.deb $ sudo apt install gnupg2 lsb-release ./percona-release_latest.*_all.deb $ sudo percona-release setup ps80 Install Percona Server for MySQL with MyRocks and the ZenFS plugin package. The binaries are listed in the Installing Percona Server for MySQL from a Binary Tarball section of the Percona Server for MySQL installation instructions. $ sudo apt install percona-server-server Install the RocksDB plugin package. This package copies ha_rocksdb.so into a predefined location. The RocksDB storage engine is not enabled . $ sudo apt install percona-server-rocksdb Configuration \u00b6 Identify your ZBD device, , with lsblk . Add the -o option and specify which columns to print. In the example, the NAME column returns the block device name, the SIZE column returns the size of the device, and the ZONED column returns information if the device uses the zone model. The value, host-managed , identifies a ZBD model. lsblk -o NAME,SIZE,ZONED NAME SIZE ZONED sda 247 .9G none | -sda1 230 .9G none | -sda2 1G none | -sda3 16G none <short_block_device_name> 7 .2T host-managed Change the ownership of to the mysql:mysql user account. $ sudo chown mysql:mysql <block_device_name> Change the permissions so that the user or owner can read and write and the MySQL group can read, in case they must take a backup, for . $ sudo chmod 640 <block_device_name> Change the scheduler to mq_deadline with a udev rule. Create /etc/udev/rules.d/60-scheduler.rules if the file does not exist, and add the following rule: ACTION==\"add|change\", KERNEL==\"<short_block_device_name>\", ATTR{queue/scheduler}=\"mq-deadline\" Restart the machine to apply the rule. Verify if the rule was applied correctly by running the following line: $ cat /sys/block/<short_block_device_name>/queue/scheduler Review that the output of the previous command matches: [mq-deadline] none Create an auxiliary directory for ZenFS. For example /var/lib/mysql_aux_nvme0n2 . The ZenFS auxiliary directory is a regular (POSIX) file directory used internally to resolve file locks and shared access. There are no strict requirements for the location but the directory must be write accessible for the mysql:mysql UNIX system user account. Each ZBD must have an individual auxiliary directory. This directory is recommended to be at the same level as \u201c/var/lib/mysql\u201d, which is the default Percona Server for MySQL directory. Note AppArmor is enabled by default in Debian 11. If your AppArmor mode is set to enforce , you must edit the profile to allow access to these locations. Add the following rules to usr.sbin.mysqld : /var/lib/mysql_aux_*/ r, /var/lib/mysql_aux_*/** rwk, Don\u2019t forget to reload the policy if you make edits: $ sudo service apparmor reload For more information, see Working with AppArmor . Note If you must configure ZenFS to use a directory inside /var/lib (owned by root:root without write permissions for other user accounts), edit your AppArmor profile (described in an earlier step), if needed, and do the following steps manually: Create the aux_path for : $ sudo mkdir /var/lib/mysql_aux_<short_block_device_name> Change the ownership of the aux_path : $ sudo chown mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql_aux_<short_block_device_name> Set the permissions for the aux_path for : $ sudo chmod 750 /var/lib/mysql_aux_<short_block_device_name> Change the ownership of . $ sudo chown mysql:mysql <block_device_name> Initialize ZenFS on . $ sudo -H -u mysql zenfs mkfs --zbd = <short_block_device_name> --aux_path = /var/lib/mysql_aux_<short_block_device_name> --finish_threshold = 0 --force Stop Percona Server for MySQL : sudo service mysql stop Edit my.cnf.

The process is efficient use of the storage space but also shortens the SSD lifespan because the SSD parts do wear out. Garbage collection can also cause large-scale write amplification. The stale data is erased in blocks, which can consist of hundreds of pages. The SSD controller searches for pages that are marked stale. Pages that are not stale but are stored in that block are moved to another block before the block is erased and marked ready for use. The zone storage model organizes the SSD into a set of zones that are uniform in size and uses the Zoned Namespaces (ZNS) technology. ZNS is optimized for an SSD and exposes this zoned block storage interface between the host and SSD. ZNS enables smart data placement. Writes are sequential within a zone. ZenFS is a file system plugin for RocksDB which uses the RocksDB file system to place files into zones on a raw zoned block device (ZBD). The plugin adds native support for ZNS, avoids on device garbage collection, and minimizes write amplification. File data is stored in a set of extents. Within a zone, extents are a contiguous part of the address space. Garbage collection is an option, but this selection can cause write amplification. ZenFS depends on the libzbd user library and requires a Linux kernel implementation that supports NVMe Zoned Namespaces. The kernel must be configured with zone block device support enabled . Read the Western Digital and Percona deliver Utrastar DC ZN540 Zoned Namespace SSD support for Percona Server for MySQL PDF for more information. The following procedure installs Percona Server for MySQL and then configures --rocksdb-fs-uri=zenfs://dev:<short_block_device_name> for data storage.

For the moment, the ZenFS plugin can be enabled in following distributions: Distribution Name Notes Debian 11.1 Able to run the ZenFS plugin Ubuntu 20.04.3 Requires the 5.11 HWE kernel patched with the allow blk-zoned ioctls without CAPT_SYS_ADMIN patch If the ZenFS functionality is not enabled on Ubuntu 20.04, the binaries with ZenFS support can run on the standard 5.4 kernel.

Once the number of connections increases past a certain point performance will degrade. This feature enables the server to keep the top performance even with a large number of client connections by introducing a dynamic thread pool. By using the thread pool server would decrease the number of threads, which will then reduce the context switching and hot locks contentions. Using the thread pool will have the most effect with OLTP workloads (relatively short CPU-bound queries). In order to enable the thread pool variable thread_handling should be set up to pool-of-threads value. This can be done by adding: thread_handling=pool-of-threads Although the default values for the thread pool should provide good performance, additional tuning can be performed with the dynamic system variables. Note Current implementation of the thread pool is built in the server, unlike the upstream version which is implemented as a plugin. Another significant implementation difference is that this implementation doesn\u2019t try to minimize the number of concurrent transactions like the MySQL Enterprise Threadpool . Because of these differences, this implementation is not compatible with the upstream version. Priority connection scheduling \u00b6 Even though thread pool puts a limit on the number of concurrently running queries, the number of open transactions may remain high, because connections with already started transactions are put to the end of the queue. Higher number of open transactions has a number of implications on the currently running queries. To improve the performance new thread_pool_high_prio_tickets variable has been introduced. This variable controls the high priority queue policy. Each new connection is assigned this many tickets to enter the high priority queue. Whenever a query has to be queued to be executed later because no threads are available, the thread pool puts the connection into the high priority queue if the following conditions apply: The connection has an open transaction in the server. The number of high priority tickets of this connection is non-zero. If both the above conditions hold, the connection is put into the high priority queue and its tickets value is decremented. Otherwise the connection is put into the common queue with the initial tickets value specified with this option. Each time the thread pool looks for a new connection to process, first it checks the high priority queue, and picks connections from the common queue only when the high priority one is empty. The goal is to minimize the number of open transactions in the server. In many cases it is beneficial to give short-running transactions a chance to commit faster and thus deallocate server resources and locks without waiting in the same queue with other connections that are about to start a new transaction, or those that have run out of their high priority tickets. The default thread pool behavior is to always put events from already started transactions into the high priority queue, as we believe that results in better performance in vast majority of cases. With the value of 0 , all connections are always put into the common queue, i.e. no priority scheduling is used as in the original implementation in MariaDB . The higher is the value, the more chances each transaction gets to enter the high priority queue and commit before it is put in the common queue. In some cases it is required to prioritize all statements for a specific connection regardless of whether they are executed as a part of a multi-statement transaction or in the autocommit mode. Or vice versa, some connections may require using the low priority queue for all statements unconditionally. To implement this new thread_pool_high_prio_mode variable has been introduced in Percona Server for MySQL . Low priority queue throttling \u00b6 One case that can limit thread pool performance and even lead to deadlocks under high concurrency is a situation when thread groups are oversubscribed due to active threads reaching the oversubscribe limit, but all/most worker threads are actually waiting on locks currently held by a transaction from another connection that is not currently in the thread pool. What happens in this case is that those threads in the pool that have marked themselves inactive are not accounted to the oversubscribe limit. As a result, the number of threads (both active and waiting) in the pool grows until it hits thread_pool_max_threads value. If the connection executing the transaction which is holding the lock has managed to enter the thread pool by then, we get a large (depending on the thread_pool_max_threads value) number of concurrently running threads, and thus, suboptimal performance as a result. Otherwise, we get a deadlock as no more threads can be created to process those transaction(s) and release the lock(s). Such situations are prevented by throttling the low priority queue when the total number of worker threads (both active and waiting ones) reaches the oversubscribe limit. That is, if there are too many worker threads, do not start new transactions and create new threads until queued events from the already started transactions are processed. Handling of Long Network Waits \u00b6 Certain types of workloads (large result sets, BLOBs, slow clients) can have longer waits on network I/O (socket reads and writes). Whenever server waits, this should be communicated to the Thread Pool, so it can start new query by either waking a waiting thread or sometimes creating a new one. This implementation has been ported from MariaDB patch MDEV-156. Version Specific Information \u00b6 8.0.12-1: Thread Pool feature was ported from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7. System Variables \u00b6 thread_pool_idle_timeout \u00b6 Option Description Command-line: Yes Config file: Yes Scope: Global Dynamic: Yes Data type: Numeric Default value: 60 (seconds) This variable can be used to limit the time an idle thread should wait before exiting. thread_pool_high_prio_mode \u00b6 Option Description Command-line: Yes Config file: Yes Scope: Global, Session Dynamic: Yes Data type: String Default value: transactions Allowed values: transactions , statements , none This variable is used to provide more fine-grained control over high priority scheduling either globally or per connection. The following values are allowed: transactions (the default). In this mode only statements from already started transactions may go into the high priority queue depending on the number of high priority tickets currently available in a connection (see thread_pool_high_prio_tickets). statements . In this mode all individual statements go into the high priority queue, regardless of connection\u2019s transactional state and the number of available high priority tickets. This value can be used to prioritize AUTOCOMMIT transactions or other kinds of statements such as administrative ones for specific connections. Note that setting this value globally essentially disables high priority scheduling, since in this case all statements from all connections will use a single queue (the high priority one) none . This mode disables high priority queue for a connection. Some connections (e.g. monitoring) may be insensitive to execution latency and/or never allocate any server resources that would otherwise impact performance in other connections and thus, do not really require high priority scheduling. Note that setting thread_pool_high_prio_mode to none globally has essentially the same effect as setting it to statements globally: all connections will always use a single queue (the low priority one in this case). thread_pool_high_prio_tickets \u00b6 Option Description Command-line: Yes Config file: Yes Scope: Global, Session Dynamic: Yes Data type: Numeric Default value: 4294967295 This variable controls the high priority queue policy.

Upgrading from a version before 8.0.14 to 8.0.14 or higher \u00b6 Starting with 8.0.14, Percona Server for MySQL uses the upstream implementation of the admin_port. The variables extra_port and extra_max_connections are removed and not supported. It is essential to remove the extra_port and extra_max_connections variables from your configuration file before you attempt to upgrade from a release before 8.0.14 to Percona Server for MySQL version 8.0.14 or higher.

Whenever a query has to be queued to be executed later because no threads are available, the thread pool puts the connection into the high priority queue if the following conditions apply: The connection has an open transaction in the server. The number of high priority tickets of this connection is non-zero. If both the above conditions hold, the connection is put into the high priority queue and its tickets value is decremented. Otherwise the connection is put into the common queue with the initial tickets value specified with this option. Each time the thread pool looks for a new connection to process, first it checks the high priority queue, and picks connections from the common queue only when the high priority one is empty. The goal is to minimize the number of open transactions in the server. In many cases it is beneficial to give short-running transactions a chance to commit faster and thus deallocate server resources and locks without waiting in the same queue with other connections that are about to start a new transaction, or those that have run out of their high priority tickets. The default thread pool behavior is to always put events from already started transactions into the high priority queue, as we believe that results in better performance in vast majority of cases. With the value of 0 , all connections are always put into the common queue, i.e. no priority scheduling is used as in the original implementation in MariaDB . The higher is the value, the more chances each transaction gets to enter the high priority queue and commit before it is put in the common queue. In some cases it is required to prioritize all statements for a specific connection regardless of whether they are executed as a part of a multi-statement transaction or in the autocommit mode. Or vice versa, some connections may require using the low priority queue for all statements unconditionally. To implement this new thread_pool_high_prio_mode variable has been introduced in Percona Server for MySQL .","title":"Priority connection scheduling"},{"location":"performance/threadpool.html#low-priority-queue-throttling","text":"One case that can limit thread pool performance and even lead to deadlocks under high concurrency is a situation when thread groups are oversubscribed due to active threads reaching the oversubscribe limit, but all/most worker threads are actually waiting on locks currently held by a transaction from another connection that is not currently in the thread pool. What happens in this case is that those threads in the pool that have marked themselves inactive are not accounted to the oversubscribe limit. As a result, the number of threads (both active and waiting) in the pool grows until it hits thread_pool_max_threads value. If the connection executing the transaction which is holding the lock has managed to enter the thread pool by then, we get a large (depending on the thread_pool_max_threads value) number of concurrently running threads, and thus, suboptimal performance as a result. Otherwise, we get a deadlock as no more threads can be created to process those transaction(s) and release the lock(s). Such situations are prevented by throttling the low priority queue when the total number of worker threads (both active and waiting ones) reaches the oversubscribe limit. That is, if there are too many worker threads, do not start new transactions and create new threads until queued events from the already started transactions are processed.","title":"Low priority queue throttling"},{"location":"performance/threadpool.html#handling-of-long-network-waits","text":"Certain types of workloads (large result sets, BLOBs, slow clients) can have longer waits on network I/O (socket reads and writes).

Some connections (e.g. monitoring) may be insensitive to execution latency and/or never allocate any server resources that would otherwise impact performance in other connections and thus, do not really require high priority scheduling.

This feature automatically adds a primary key to InnoDB tables without a primary key. The generated key is always named my_row_id . The GIPK feature is not enabled by default. Enable the feature by setting sql_generate_invisible_primary_key to ON. The InnoDB_doublewrite system has two new settings: DETECT_ONLY . This setting allows only metadata to be written to the doublewrite buffer. Database page content is not written to the buffer. Recovery does not use the buffer to fix incomplete page writes. Use this setting only when you need to detect incomplete page writes. DETECT_AND_RECOVER . This setting is equivalent to the current ON setting. The doublewrite buffer is enabled. Database page content is written to the buffer and the buffer is accessed to fix incomplete page writes during recovery. The -skip_host_cache server option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use SET GLOBAL host_cache_size = 0 or set host_cache_size = 0. Find the full list of bug fixes and changes in the MySQL 8.0.30 Release Notes . New features \u00b6 PS-8255 : Added support to enable users to authenticate using FIDO authentication . PS-6002 : Added the global variable --replica-enable-event to maintain the create/alter event state on replicas. PS-7980 : Added the global system variables --authentication_ldap_simple_group_role_mapping and --authentication_ldap_sasl_group_role_mapping . When a user logs in with LDAP authentication, the server checks if the LDAP user is a member of any group specified in this variable. If the check is successful, the matching MySQL roles are automatically granted to the user. PS-8275 : Implements the ability to eject a cluster node when the node exceeds the flow control threshold by adding a MAJORITY mode to group_replication_flow_control_mode and a global system variable group_replication_auto_evict_timeout . Improvements \u00b6 PS-8385 : Adds the ability to call user-defined functions to register a redo log consumer. A consumer reading the redo log blocks files from being deleted or purged. PS-8169 : Adds the ability to use Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) to send secure messages within the LDAP protocol with the SASL-based LDAP authentication. The authentication_ldap_sasl plugin performs the SASL-based LDAP authentication on the server. The client must use the authentication_ldap_sasl_client plugin. PS-8155 : Implements support for multiple LDAP server for the simple LDAP authentication plugin and the SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin. If the appropriate system variable is set, and if the primary server is unavailable, the authentication plugin attempts to connect and authenticate using a fallback server. A user can also specify multiple fallback servers. The following global system variables are: authentication_ldap_simple_fallback_server_host authentication_ldap_simple_fallback_server_port authentication_ldap_sasl_fallback_server_host authentication_ldap_sasl_fallback_server_port Bug fixes \u00b6 PS-8204 : A fix for when the audit_log_format was set to XML and the logged queries were truncated after a newline character. PS-8246 : Adapted the Encryption UDF MTR test cases to OpenSL 3.0.x. The tests failed because OpenSSL 3.0.x has a different default set of hash functions and PEM reading and writing routines generate different error messages.

This feature automatically adds a primary key to InnoDB tables without a primary key. The generated key is always named my_row_id . The GIPK feature is not enabled by default. Enable the feature by setting sql_generate_invisible_primary_key to ON. The InnoDB_doublewrite system has two new settings: DETECT_ONLY . This setting allows only metadata to be written to the doublewrite buffer. Database page content is not written to the buffer. Recovery does not use the buffer to fix incomplete page writes. Use this setting only when you need to detect incomplete page writes. DETECT_AND_RECOVER . This setting is equivalent to the current ON setting. The doublewrite buffer is enabled. Database page content is written to the buffer and the buffer is accessed to fix incomplete page writes during recovery. The -skip_host_cache server option is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use SET GLOBAL host_cache_size = 0 or set host_cache_size = 0.

New Features \u00b6 Percona Server for MySQL has implemented the ability to have a MySQL Utility user who has system access to do administrative tasks but limited access to user schemas. The user is invisible to other users. This feature is especially useful to those who are operating MySQL as a Service. This feature has the same functionality as the utility user in earlier versions and has been delay-ported to version 8.0. Percona Server for MySQL has implemented data masking . Bugs Fixed \u00b6 Changed the default of innodb_empty_free_list_algorithm to backoff .

Percona Server for MySQL\u00ae is a free, fully compatible, enhanced and open source drop-in replacement for any MySQL database. It provides superior performance, scalability and instrumentation. Percona Server for MySQL is trusted by thousands of enterprises to provide better performance and concurrency for their most demanding workloads, and delivers greater value to MySQL server users with optimized performance, greater performance scalability and availability, enhanced backups and increased visibility. Commercial support contracts are available . Release Highlights \u00b6 We have integrated a ZenFS RocksDB plugin to Percona Server for MySQL. This plugin places files on a raw zoned block device (ZBD) using the MyRocks File System interface. For more information, see Installing and configuring Percona Server for MySQL with ZenFS support. The following list are some of the bug fixes for MySQL 8.0.26, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL: #104575 : In the PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA.Threads table, the srv_purge_thread and srv_worker_thread values are duplicated. #104387 : When using REGEX comparison, a CHARACTER_SET_MISMATCH error is thrown. #104576 : Accessing the second index in a partition table with many columns can create a high CPU load.

AppArmor supplements the DAC with a Mandatory Access Control (MAC) system. AppArmor is the default security module for Ubuntu or Debian systems and uses profiles to define how programs access resources. AppArmor is path-based and restricts processes by using profiles. Each profile contains a set of policy rules. Some applications may install their profile along with the application. If an installation does not also install a profile, then that application is not part of the AppArmor subsystem. You can also create profiles since they are simple text files stored in the /etc/apparmor.d directory. A profile is in one of the following modes: Enforce - the default setting, applications are prevented from taking actions restricted by the profile rules. Complain - applications are allowed to take restricted actions, and the actions are logged. Disabled - Applications are allowed to take restricted actions, and the actions are not logged. You can mix enforce profiles and complain profiles in your server. Install the Utilities used to control AppArmor \u00b6 Install the apparmor-utils package to work with profiles. Use these utilities to create, update, enforce, switch to complain mode, and disable profiles, as needed: $ sudo apt install apparmor-utils The output could be the following: Reading package lists...

The Percona Data Masking plugin is a free and Open Source implementation of the MySQL \u2019s data masking plugin. Data Masking provides a set of functions to hide sensitive data with modified content. Data masking can have either of the characteristics: Generation of random data, such as an email address De-identify data by transforming the data to hide content Installing the plugin \u00b6 The following command installs the plugin: $ INSTALL PLUGIN data_masking SONAME 'data_masking.so' ; Data Masking functions \u00b6 The data masking functions have the following categories: General purpose Special purpose Generating Random Data with Defined characteristics Using Dictionaries to Generate Random Data General Purpose \u00b6 The general purpose data masking functions are the following: Parameter Description mask_inner(string, margin1, margin2 [, character]) Returns a result where only the inner part of a string is masked. An optional masking character can be specified. mask_outer(string, margin1, margin2 [, character]) Masks the outer part of the string. The inner section is not masked. Examples \u00b6 An example of mask_inner : mysql > SELECT mask_inner ( '123456789' , 1 , 2 ); The output is the following: +-----------------------------------+ | mask_inner('123456789', 1, 2) | +-----------------------------------+ |1XXXXXX89 | +-----------------------------------+ An example of mask_outer : mysql > SELECT mask_outer ( '123456789' , 2 , 2 ); The output is the following: +------------------------------------+ | mask_outer('123456789', 2, 2). | +------------------------------------+ | XX34567XX | +------------------------------------+ Special Purpose \u00b6 The special purpose data masking functions are as follows: Parameter Description mask_pan(string) Masks the Primary Account Number (PAN) by replacing the string with an \u201cX\u201d except for the last four characters. The PAN string must be 15 characters or 16 characters in length. mask_pan_relaxed(string) Returns the first six numbers and the last four numbers. The rest of the string is replaced by \u201cX\u201d. mask_ssn(string) Returns a string with only the last four numbers visible. The rest of the string is replaced by \u201cX\u201d. Examples \u00b6 An example of mask_pan . mysql > SELECT mask_pan ( gen_rnd_pan ()); The output is the following: +------------------------------------+ | mask_pan(gen_rnd_pan()) | +------------------------------------+ | XXXXXXXXXXX2345 | +------------------------------------+ An example of mask_pan_relaxed : mysql > SELECT mask_pan_relaxed ( gen_rnd_pan ()); The output is the following: +------------------------------------------+ | mask_pan_relaxed(gen_rnd_pan()) | +------------------------------------------+ | 520754XXXXXX4848 | +------------------------------------------+ An example of mask_ssn : mysql > SELECT mask_ssn ( '555-55-5555' ); The output is the following: +-------------------------+ | mask_ssn('555-55-5555') | +-------------------------+ | XXX-XX-5555 | +-------------------------+ Generating Random Data for Specific Requirements \u00b6 These functions generate random values for specific requirements. Parameter Description gen_range(lower, upper) Generates a random number based on a selected range and supports negative numbers. gen_rnd_email() Generates a random email address. The domain is example.com. gen_rnd_pan([size in integer]) Generates a random primary account number. This function should only be used for test purposes. gen_rnd_us_phone() Generates a random U.S. phone number. The generated number adds the 1 dialing code and is in the 555 area code. The 555 area code is not valid for any U.S. phone number. gen_rnd_ssn() Generates a random, non-legitimate US Social Security Number in an AAA-BBB-CCCC format.

The dictionary must be loaded from a file with the following characteristics: Plain text One term per line Must contain at least one entry Copy the dictionary files to a directory accessible to MySQL. The secure-file-priv option defines the directories where gen_dictionary_load() loads the dictionary files. Note Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.21-12 enabled using the secure-file-priv option for gen_dictionary_load(). Parameter Description Returns gen_blacklist(str, dictionary_name, replacement_dictionary_name) Replaces a term with a term from a second dictionary. A dictionary term gen_dictionary(dictionary_name) Randomizes the dictionary terms A random term from the selected dictionary. gen_dictionary_drop(dictionary_name) Removes the selected dictionary from the dictionary registry.

Upgrading from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.15-5 to any Higher Version \u00b6 Starting from the release of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.15-5, Percona Server for MySQL uses the upstream implementation of the binary log file and relay log file encryption. The encrypt-binlog variable is removed, and the related command-line option \u2013encrypt-binlog is not supported. It is important to remove the encrypt-binlog variable from your configuration file before you attempt to upgrade either from another release in the Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 series or from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7. Otherwise, a server boot error is generated and reports an unknown variable. The implemented binary log file encryption is compatible with the older format. The encrypted binary log file used in a previous version of MySQL 8.0 series or Percona Server for MySQL series is supported. Architecture \u00b6 The Binary log encryption uses the following tiers: File password Binary log file encryption key The file password encrypts the content of a single binary file or relay log file. The binary log encryption key encrypts the file password and the key is stored in the keyring. Implementation \u00b6 After you have enabled the binlog_encryption variable and the keyring is available, you can encrypt the data content for new binary log files and relay log files. Only the data content is encrypted. Attempting a binary log file or relay log file encryption without the keyring generates a MySQL error. In replication, the source maintains the binary log and the replica maintains a binary log copy called the relay log. The source copies a stream of decrypted binary log events to a replica using SSL connections to encrypt the stream. The events are re-executed on the replica. The source and replicas can use separate keyring storage and different keyring plugins. When the binlog_encryption is set to OFF , the server rotates the binary log files and the relay log files and all new log files are unencrypted. The encrypted files are not unencrypted, but the server can read the files. When an encrypted binary log is dumped, and this operation involves decryption, use mysqlbinlog with the --read-from-remote-server option. Note The \u2013read-from-remote-server option only applies to the binary logs. Encrypted relay logs can not be dumped or decrypted with this option. Enabling Binary Log Encryption \u00b6 In versions Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.15-5 and later, set the binlog_encryption variable to ON in a startup configuration file, such as my.cnf . The variable is set to OFF by default. binlog_encryption=ON Verifying the Encryption \u00b6 To verify if the binary log encryption option is enabled, run the following statement: mysqlSHOW BINARY LOGS ; The output could be the following: +-------------------+----------------+---------------+ | Log_name | File_size | Encrypted | +-------------------+----------------+---------------+ | binlog.00011 | 72367 | No | | binlog:00012 | 71503 | No | | binlog:00013 | 73762 | Yes | +-------------------+----------------+---------------+ The SHOW BINARY LOGS statement displays the name, size, and if a binary log file is encrypted or unencrypted.

The functions may take an algorithm argument. Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext using a key and an encryption algorithm. You can also use the user-defined functions with the PEM format keys generated externally by the OpenSSL utility. A digest uses plaintext and generates a hash value. This hash value can verify if the plaintext is unmodified. You can also sign or verify on digests to ensure that the original plaintext was not modified. You cannot decrypt the original text from the hash value. When choosing key lengths, consider the following: Encryption strength increases with the key size and, also, the key generation time. If performance is important and the functions are frequently used, use symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption functions are faster than asymmetric encryption functions. Moreover, asymmetric encryption has restrictions on the maximum length of a message being encrypted. For example, for RSA the algorithm maximum message size is the key length in bytes (key length in bits / 8) minus 11. The following table and sections describe the functions. For examples, see function examples.

The functions may take an algorithm argument. Encryption converts plaintext into ciphertext using a key and an encryption algorithm. You can also use the user-defined functions with the PEM format keys generated externally by the OpenSSL utility. A digest uses plaintext and generates a hash value. This hash value can verify if the plaintext is unmodified. You can also sign or verify on digests to ensure that the original plaintext was not modified. You cannot decrypt the original text from the hash value. When choosing key lengths, consider the following: Encryption strength increases with the key size and, also, the key generation time. If performance is important and the functions are frequently used, use symmetric encryption. Symmetric encryption functions are faster than asymmetric encryption functions. Moreover, asymmetric encryption has restrictions on the maximum length of a message being encrypted. For example, for RSA the algorithm maximum message size is the key length in bytes (key length in bits / 8) minus 11. The following table and sections describe the functions.

FIDO can be used to create 1FA accounts that do not require passwords. For instructions, see Use FIDO . Use FIDO authentication with non-FIDO authentication \u00b6 A FIDO device is associated with the account using FIDO authentication. The FIDO device must be registered before the account can be used in a one-time process. This device must be available and the user must perform whatever FIDO device action required, such as adding a thumbprint, or the registration fails. The registration can only be performed by the user named by the account. An error occurs if a user attempts the registration for another user. The device registration can be performed on the mysql client or MySQL Shell. Use the --fido-register-factor option with the factor or factors for the device. For example, if you are using FIDO as a second authentication method, which is a common practice, the statement is --fido-register-factor=2 . Any authentication factors that proceed the FIDO registration must succeed before the registration continues. The server checks the user account information to determine if the FIDO device requires registration. If the device must be registered, the server switches the client session to sandbox mode. The registration must be completed before any other activity. In this mode, only ALTER USER statements are permitted. If the session is started with --fido-register-factor , the client generates the statements required to register. After the registration is complete, the session is switched out of sandbox mode and the client can proceed as normal. After the device is registered, the server updates the mysql.user system table for that account with the device registration status and stores the public key and credential ID. The user must use the same FIDO device during registration and authentication. If the device is reset or the user attempts to use a different device, the authentication fails. To use a different device, the registered device must be unregistered and you must complete the registration process again. Use FIDO authentication as the only method \u00b6 If FIDO is used as the only method of authentication, the method does not use a password.

Version Changes \u00b6 Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.30-22 implements an SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin. This plugin only supports the SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism. Important The SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin is a tech preview feature. Before using this plugin in production, we recommend that you test restoring your production databases from physical backups in your environment, and also use an alternative backup method for redundancy. Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.19-10 implements the simple LDAP authentication. The Percona simple LDAP authentication plugin is a free and Open Source implementation of the MySQL Enterprise Simple LDAP authentication plugin. Plugin names and file names \u00b6 The following tables show the plugin names and the file name for simple LDAP authentication and SASL-based LDAP authentication. Simple LDAP authentication plugin names and library name SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin names and library names Plugin or file Plugin name or file name Server-side plugin authentication_ldap_simple client-side plugin mysql_clear_password library file authentication_ldap_simple.so Plugin or file Plugin name or file name Server-side plugin authentication_ldap_sasl client-side plugin authentication_ldap_sasl_client library files authentication_ldap_sasl.so authentication_ldap_sasl_client.so How does the authentication work \u00b6 The server-side LDAP plugins work only with the specific client-side plugin: The authentication_ldap_simple plugin, on the server, performs the simple LDAP authentication. The client, using mysql_clear_password , connects to the server. The client plugin sends the password to the server as cleartext. For this method, use a secure connection between the client and server. The authentication_ldap_sasl plugin, on the server, performs the SASL-based LDAP authentication. The client must use the authentication_ldap_sasl_client plugin. The method does not send the password to the server in cleartext. The server-side and client-side plugins use Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) to send secure messages within the LDAP protocol. For either method, the database server rejects the connection if the client user name and the host name do not match a server account. If a database server LDAP authentication is successful, the LDAP server searches for an entry. The LDAP server matches the user and authenticates using the LDAP password. If the database server account names the LDAP user distinguished name (DN), added by the IDENTIFIED WITH <plugin-name> BY '<auth-string>' clause, the LDAP server uses that value and the LDAP password provided by the client. This method fails if the DN and password have incorrect values If the LDAP server finds multiple matches or no match, authentication fails. If the password is correct, and the LDAP server finds a match, then LDAP authentication succeeds. The LDAP server returns the LDAP entry and the authentication plugin determines the authenticated user\u2019s name based on the entry. If the LDAP entry has no group attribute, the plugin returns the client user name as the authenticated name. If the LDAP entry has a group attribute, the plugin returns the group value as the authenticated name. The database server compares the client user name to the authenticated user name. If these names are the same, the database server uses the client user name to check for privileges. If the name differs, then the database server looks for an account that matches the authenticated name. Prerequisites for authentication \u00b6 The LDAP authentication plugins required the following: An available LDAP server The LDAP server must contain the LDAP user accounts to be authenticated The OpenLDAP client library must be available on the same system as the plugin The SASL-based LDAP authentication additionally requires the following: Configure the LDAP server to communicate with a SASL server Available SASL client library on the same system as the client plugin. Services are configured to use the supported SCRAM-SHA-1 SASL mechanism Install the plugins \u00b6 You can use either of the following methods to install the plugins. The SASL-based LDAP authentication is available on Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.30-22 and later. Load the plugins at server start \u00b6 Use either of the following methods to load the plugin at server start. Load the simple LDAP authentication Load the SASL_based LDAP authentication plugin Add the following statements to your my.cnf file to load simple LDAP authentication: [mysqld] plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_simple.so authentication_ldap_simple_server_host=127.0.0.1 authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn='dc=percona, dc=com' Restart the server for the changes to take effect. Add the following statements to your my.cnf file to load the SASL-based LDAP authentication: [mysqld] plugin-load-add=authentication_ldap_sasl.so authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host=127.0.0.1 authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn='dc=percona, dc=com' Load the plugins at runtime \u00b6 Install the plugin with the following statements. Load the simple LDAP authentication plugin Load the SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin mysql > INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_simple SONAME 'authentication_ldap_simple.so' ; To set and persist values at runtime, use the following statements: mysql > SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_simple_server_host = '127.0.0.1' ; mysql > SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn = 'dc=percona, dc=com' ; mysql > INSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_sasl SONAME ' authentication_ldap_sasl . so ` ; To set and persist values at runtime, use the following statements: mysql > SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_sasl_server_host = '127.0.0.1' ; mysql > SET PERSIST authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn = 'dc=percona, dc=com' ; Create a user using simple LDAP authentication \u00b6 There are several methods to add or modify a user. Use authentication_ldap_simple plugin Use the authentication string in simple LDAP In the CREATE USER statement or the ALTER USER statement, for simple LDAP authentication, you can specify the authentication_ldap_simple plugin in the IDENTIFIED WITH clause: mysql> CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple; Using the IDENTIFIED WITH clause, the database server assigns the specified plugin. If you provide the optional authentication string clause, \u2018cn,ou,dc,dc\u2019 in the example, the string is stored along with the password. mysql> CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple BY 'cn=[user name],ou=[organization unit],dc=[domain component],dc=com' Unless the authentication_ldap_simple_group_role_mapping variable is used, creating a user with an authentication string does not use the following system variables: authentication_ldap_simple_bind_base_dn authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_dn authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_pwd authentication_ldap_simple_user_search_attr authentication_ldap_simple_group_search_attr Creating the user with IDENTIFIED BY authentication_ldap_simple uses the variables. Creating the user with the authentication_ldap_simple_group_role_mapping variable also adds the authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_dn and authentication_ldap_simple_bind_root_pwd variables. Create a user using SASL-based LDAP authentication \u00b6 There are several methods to add or modify a user. Use authentication_ldap_sasl plugin Use the authentication string in SASL-based LDAP For SASL-based LDAP authentication, in the CREATE USER statement or the ALTER USER statement, you can specify the authentication_ldap_sasl plugin: mysql> CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl; If you provide the optional authentication string clause, \u2018cn,ou,dc,dc\u2019 in the example, the string is stored along with the password. mysql> CREATE USER ... IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl BY 'cn=[user name],ou=[organization unit],dc=[domain component],dc=com' Unless the authentication_ldap_sasl_group_role_mapping variable is used, creating a user with an authentication string does not use the following system variables: authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_base_dn authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_dn authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_pwd authentication_ldap_sasl_user_search_attr authentication_ldap_sasl_group_search_attr Creating the user with IDENTIFIED BY authentication_ldap_sasl uses the variables. Creating the user with the authentication_ldap_sasl_group_role_mapping variable also adds the authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_dn and authentication_ldap_sasl_bind_root_pwd variables. Examples \u00b6 The following sections are examples of using simple LDAP authentication and SASL-based LDAP authentication. For the purposes of this example, we use the following LDAP user: uid=ldapuser,ou=testusers,dc=percona,dc=com Simple LDAP authentication SASL-based LDAP authentication The following example configures an LDAP user and connects to the database server. Create a database server account for ldapuser with the following statement: mysql > CREATE USER 'ldapuser' @ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_simple BY 'uid=ldapuser,ou=testusers,dc=percona,dc=com' ; The authentication string does not include the LDAP password. This password must be provided by the client user when they connect. mysql > mysql --user=ldapuser --password --enable-cleartext-plugin The user enters the ldapuser password. The client sends the password as cleartext, which is necessary when using a server-side LDAP library without SASL. The following actions may minimize the risk: Require that the database server clients explicitly enable the mysql_clear_password plugin with --enable-cleartext-plugin . Require that the database server clients connect to the database server using an encrypted connection The following example configures an LDAP user and connect to the database server. Create a database server account for ldapuser with the following statement: mysql > CREATE USER 'ldapuser' @ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_ldap_sasl AS 'uid=ldapuser,ou=testusers,dc=percona,dc=com' ; The authentication string does not include the LDAP password. This password must be provided by the client user when they connect. Clients connect ot the database server by providing the database server user name and LDAP password: mysql > mysql --user=ldapuser --password The authentication is similar to the authentication method used by simple LDAP authentication, except that the client and the database server SASL LDAP plugins use SASL messages. These messages are secure within the LDAP protocol. Uninstall the plugins \u00b6 If you installed either plugin at server startup , remove those options from the my.cnf file, remove any startup options that set LDAP system variables, and restart the server. Uninstall the simple LDAP authentication plugin Uninstall the SASL-based LDAP authentication plugin If you installed the plugins at runtime , run the following statements: mysql > UNINSTALL PLUGIN authentication_ldap_simple ; If you used SET_PERSIST , use RESET PERSIST to remove the settings.

This plugin acts as a mediator between the MySQL server, the MySQL client, and the PAM stack. The server plugin requests authentication from the PAM stack, forwards any requests and messages from the PAM stack over the wire to the client (in cleartext) and reads back any replies for the PAM stack. PAM plugin uses dialog as its client side plugin. Dialog plugin can be loaded to any client application that uses libperconaserverclient / libmysqlclient library. Here are some of the benefits that Percona dialog plugin offers over the default one: It correctly recognizes whether PAM wants input to be echoed or not, while the default one always echoes the input on the user\u2019s console. It can use the password which is passed to MySQL client via \u201c-p\u201d parameter. Dialog client installation bug has been fixed. This plugin works on MySQL and Percona Server for MySQL . Percona offers two versions of this plugin: Full PAM plugin called auth_pam . This plugin uses dialog.so . It fully supports the PAM protocol with arbitrary communication between client and server. Oracle-compatible PAM called auth_pam_compat . This plugin uses mysql_clear_password which is a part of Oracle MySQL client. It also has some limitations, such as, it supports only one password input. You must use -p option in order to pass the password to auth_pam_compat . These two versions of plugins are physically different. To choose which one you want used, you must use IDENTIFIED WITH \u2018auth_pam\u2019 for auth_pam, and IDENTIFIED WITH \u2018auth_pam_compat\u2019 for auth_pam_compat. Version Specific Information \u00b6 8.0.12-1: The feature was ported from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7. Installation \u00b6 This plugin requires manual installation because it isn\u2019t installed by default. mysql > INSTALL PLUGIN auth_pam SONAME 'auth_pam.so' ; After the plugin has been installed it should be present in the plugins list. To check if the plugin has been correctly installed and active mysqlSHOW PLUGINS ; The output should resemble the following: ... | auth_pam | ACTIVE | AUTHENTICATION | auth_pam.so | GPL | Configuration \u00b6 In order to use the plugin, authentication method should be configured. Simple setup can be to use the standard UNIX authentication method ( pam_unix ). Note To use pam_unix , mysql will need to be added to the shadow group in order to have enough privileges to read the /etc/shadow. A sample /etc/pam.d/mysqld file: auth required pam_unix.so account required pam_unix.so For added information in the system log, you can expand it to be: auth required pam_warn.so auth required pam_unix.so audit account required pam_unix.so audit Creating a user \u00b6 After the PAM plugin has been configured, users can be created with the PAM plugin as authentication method mysql > CREATE USER 'newuser' @ 'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH auth_pam ; This will create a user newuser that can connect from localhost who will be authenticated using the PAM plugin. If the pam_unix method is being used user will need to exist on the system. Supplementary groups support \u00b6 Percona Server for MySQL has implemented PAM plugin support for supplementary groups. Supplementary or secondary groups are extra groups a specific user is member of. For example user joe might be a member of groups: joe (his primary group) and secondary groups developers and dba . A complete list of groups and users belonging to them can be checked with cat /etc/group command. This feature enables using secondary groups in the mapping part of the authentication string, like \u201c mysql, developers=joe, dba=mark \u201d. Previously only primary groups could have been specified there. If user is a member of both developers and dba , PAM plugin will map it to the joe because developers matches first. Known issues \u00b6 Default mysql stack size is not enough to handle pam_encryptfs module. The workaround is to increase the MySQL stack size by setting the thread-stack variable to at least 512KB or by increasing the old value by 256KB . PAM authentication can fail with mysqld: pam_unix(mysqld:account): Fork failed: Cannot allocate memory error in the /var/log/secure even when there is enough memory available. Current workaround is to set vm.overcommit_memory to 1 : echo 1 /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory and by adding the vm.overcommit_memory = 1 to /etc/sysctl.conf to make the change permanent after reboot. Authentication of internal (i.e. non PAM) accounts continues to work fine when mysqld reaches this memory utilization level.

This module provides a way to support mandatory access control policies. SELinux defines how confined processes interact with files, network ports, directories, other processes, and additional server components. An SELinux policy defines the set of rules, the types for files, and the domains for processes. Rules determine how a process interacts with another type. SELinux decides whether to allow or deny an action based on the subject\u2019s context, what object initiates the action and what object is the action\u2019s target. A label represents the context for administrators and users. CentOS 7 and CentOS 8 contain a MySQL SELinux policy. Percona Server for MySQL is a drop-in replacement for MySQL and can use this policy without changes. SELinux context example \u00b6 To view the SELinux context, add the -Z switch to many of the utilities. Here is an example of the context for mysqld : $ ps -eZ | grep mysqld_t The output should resemble the following: system_u:system_r:mysqld_t:s0 3356 ? 00:00:01 mysqld The context has the following properties: User - system_u Role - system_r Type or domain - mysqld_t Sensitivity level - s0 3356 Most SELinux policy rules are based on the type or domain. List SELinux Types or Domains associated with files \u00b6 The security property that SELinux relies on is the Type security property. The type name often end with a _t . A group of objects with the same type security value belongs to the same domain. To view the mysqldb_t types associated with the MySQL directories and files, run the following command: $ ls -laZ /var/lib/ | grep mysql The output should resemble the following: drwxr-x--x. mysql mysql system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0 mysql drwxr-x---. mysql mysql system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0 mysql-files drwxr-x---. mysql mysql system_u:object_r:mysqld_db_t:s0 mysql-keyring Note If a policy type does not define the type property for an object, the default value is unconfined_t . SELinux modes \u00b6 SELinux has the following modes: Disabled - No SELinux policy modules loaded, which disables policies. Nothing is reported. Permissive - SELinux is active, but policy modules are not enforced. A policy violation is reported but does not stop the action. Enforcing - SELinux is active, and violations are reported and denied. If there is no rule to allow access to a confined resource, SELinux denies the access. Policy Types \u00b6 SELinux has several policy types: Targeted - Most processes operate without restriction. Specific services are contained in security domains and defined by policies. Strict - All processes are contained in security domains and defined by policies. SELinux has confined processes that run in a domain and restricts everything unless explicitly allowed. An unconfined process in an unconfined domain is allowed almost all access. MySQL is a confined process, and the policy module defines which files are read, which ports are opened, and so on. SELinux assumes the Percona Server for MySQL installation uses the default file locations and default ports. If you change the default, you must also edit the policy. If you do not update the policy, SELinux, in enforcing mode, denies access to all non-default resources. Check the SELinux mode \u00b6 To check the current SELinux mode, use either of the following commands: $ sestatus The output should resemble the following: SELinux status: enabled SELinuxfs mount: /sys/fs/selinux SELinux root directory: /etc/selinux Loaded policy name: targeted Current mode: enforcing Mode from config file: enforcing Policy MLS status: enabled Policy deny_unknown status: allowed Memory protection checking: actual (secure) Max kernel policy version: 31 or $ grep ^SELINUX = /etc/selinux/config The output should resemble the following: SELINUX=enforcing Note Add the -b parameter to sestatus to display the Policy booleans . The boolean values for each parameter is shown. An example of using the b parameter is the following: $ sestatus -b | grep mysql The output should resemble the following: mysql_connect_any off selinuxuser_mysql_connect_enabled The /etc/selinux/config file controls if SELinux is disabled or enabled, and if enabled, whether SELinux operates in enforcing mode or permissive mode. Disable SELinux \u00b6 If you plan to use the enforcing mode at another time, use the permissive mode instead of disabling SELinux. During the time that SELinux is disabled, the system may contain mislabeled objects or objects with no label. If you re-enable SELinux and plan to set SELinux to enforcing, you must follow the steps to Relabel the entire file system. On boot, to disable SELinux, set the selinux=0 kernel option. The kernel does not load the SELinux infrastructure. This option has the same effect as changing the SELINUX=disabled instruction in the configuration file and then rebooting the system. Additional SELinux tools \u00b6 Install the SELinux management tools, such as semanage or sesearch , if needed. On RHEL 7 or compatible operating systems, use the following command as root: $ yum -y install policycoreutils-python On RHEL 8 or compatible operating systems, use the following command as root: $ yum -y install policycoreutils-python-utils Note You may need root privileges to run SELinux management commands. Switch the mode in the configuration file \u00b6 Switching between modes may help when troubleshooting or when modifying rules. To permanently change the mode, edit the /etc/selinux/config file and change the SELINUX= value. You should also verify the change. $ cat /etc/selinux/config | grep SELINUX = | grep -v ^# The output should resemble the following: SELINUX=enforcing SELINUX=enforcing $ sudo sed -i 's/^SELINUX=.*/SELINUX=permissive/g' /etc/selinux/config $ cat /etc/selinux/config | grep SELINUX = | grep -v ^# The output should resemble the following: SELINUX=permissive SELINUX=permissive Reboot your system after the change. If switching from either disabled mode or permissive mode to enforcing, see Relabel the entire file system. Switch the mode until the next reboot \u00b6 To change the mode until the next reboot, use either of the following commands as root: $ setenforce Enforcing or $ setenforce 1 Note The following setenforce parameters are available: | setenforce parameters setenforce parameters Also Permitted 0 Permissive 1 Enforcing You can view the current mode by running either of the following commands: $ getenforce The output should resemble the following: Enforcing or $ sestatus | grep -i mode The output should resemble the following: Current mode: permissive Mode from config file: enforcing Switch the mode for a service \u00b6 You can move one or more services into a permissive domain. The other services remain in enforcing mode. To add a service to the permissive domain, run the following as root: $ sudo semanage permissive -a mysqld_t To list the current permissive domains, run the following command: $ sudo semanage permissive -l ``` The output should resemble the following: ``` text ... Customized Permissive Types mysqld_t Builtin Permissive Types To delete a service from the permissive domain, run the following: $ sudo semanage permissive -d mysqld_t The service returns to the system\u2019s SELinux mode. Be sure to follow the steps to Relabel the entire file system. Relabel the entire file system \u00b6 Switching from disabled or permissive to enforcing requires additional steps. The enforcing mode requires the correct contexts, or labels, to function. The permissive mode allows users and processes to label files and system objects incorrectly. The disabled mode does not load the SELinux infrastructure and does not label resources or processes. RHEL and compatible systems, use the fixfiles application for relabeling. You can relabel the entire file system or the file contexts of an application. For one application, run the following command: $ fixfiles -R mysqld restore To relabel the file system without rebooting the system, use the following command: $ fixfiles -f -F relabel Another option relabels the file system during a reboot. You can either add a touch file, read during the reboot operation, or configure a kernel boot parameter. The completion of the relabeling operation automatically removes the touch file. Add the touch file as root: $ touch /.autorelabel To configure the kernel, add the autorelabel=1 kernel parameter to the boot parameter list. The parameter forces a system relabel. Reboot in permissive mode to allow the process to complete before changing to enforcing. Note Relabeling an entire filesystem takes time. When the relabeling is complete, the system reboots again. Set a Custom Data directory \u00b6 If you do not use the default settings, SELinux, in enforcing mode, prevents access to the system. For example, during installation, you have used the following configuration: datadir=/var/lib/mysqlcustom socket=/var/lib/mysqlcustom/mysql.sock Restart the service. $ service mysqld restart The output could be the following: Redirecting to /bin/systemctl restart mysqld.service Job for mysqld.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See \"systemctl status mysqld.service\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details. Check the journal log to see the error code. $ journalctl -xe The output could be the following: ... SELinux is preventing mysqld from getattr access to the file /var/lib/mysqlcustom/ibdata1. ... Check the SELinux types in /var/lib/mysqlcustom . ls -1aZ /var/lib/mysqlcustom The output could be the following: text total 164288 drwxr-x--x. 6 mysql mysql system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0 4096 Dec 2 07:58 . drwxr-xr-x. 38 root root system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0 4096 Dec 1 14:29 .. ... -rw-r-----. 1 mysql mysql system_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0 12582912 Dec 1 14:29 ibdata1 ... To solve the issue, use the following methods: Set the proper labels for mysqlcustom files Change the mysqld SELinux policy to allow mysqld access to var_lib_t files. The recommended solution is to set the proper labels. The following procedure assumes you have already created and set ownership to the custom data directory location: To change the SELinux context, use semanage fcontext . In this step, you define how SELinux deals with the custom paths: $ semanage fcontext -a -e /var/lib/mysql /var/lib/mysqlcustom SELinux applies the same labeling schema, defined in the mysqld policy, for the /var/lib/mysql directory to the custom directory. Files created within the custom directory are labeled as if they were in /var/lib/mysql . To restorecon command applies the change. $ restorecon -R -v /var/lib/mysqlcustom Restart the mysqld service: $ service mysqld start Set a Custom Log Location \u00b6 If you do not use the default settings, SELinux, in enforcing mode, prevents access to the location. Change the log location to a custom location in my.cnf: log-error=/logs/mysqld.log Verify the log location with the following command: $ ls -laZ / The output could be: ... drwxrwxrwx. 2 root root unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0 6 Dec 2 09:16 logs ... Starting MySQL returns the following message: $ service mysql start The output could be: Redirecting to /bin/systemctl start mysql.service Job for mysqld.service failed because the control process exited with error code. See \"systemctl status mysqld.service\" and \"journalctl -xe\" for details. $ journalctl -xe ... SELinux is preventing mysqld from write access to the directory logs. ... The default SELinux policy allows mysqld to write logs into a location tagged with var_log_t , which is the /var/log location. You can solve the issue with either of the following methods: Tag the /logs location properly Edit the SELinux policy to allow mysqld access to all directories. To tag the custom /logs location is the recommended method since it locks down access. Run the following commands to tag the custom location: $ semanage fcontext -a -t var_log_t /logs $ restorecon -v /logs You may not be able to change the /logs directory label. For example, other applications, with their own rules, use the same directory. To adjust the SELinux policy when a directory is shared, follow these steps: Create a local policy: ausearch -c 'mysqld' --raw | audit2allow -M my-mysqld This command generates the my-mysqld.te and the my-mysqld.pp files. The mysqld.te is the type enforcement policy file. The my-mysqld.pp is the policy module loaded as a binary file into the SELinux subsystem. An example of the my-myslqd.te file: module my-mysqld 1.0; require { *type mysqld_t*; type var_lib_t; *type default_t*; class file getattr; *class dir write*; } #============= mysqld_t ============== *allow mysqld_t default_t:dir write*; allow mysqld_t var_lib_t:file getattr; The policy contains rules for the custom data directory and the custom logs directory. We have set the proper labels for the data directory location, and applying this auto-generated policy would loosen our hardening by allowing mysqld to access var_lib_t tags. SELinux-generated events are converted to rules. A generated policy may contain rules for recent violations and include unrelated rules. Unrelated rules are generated from actions, such as changing the data directory location, that are not related to the logs directory. Add the --start parameter to use log events after a specific time to filter out the unwanted events. This parameter captures events when the time stamp is equal to the specified time or later. SELinux generates a policy for the current actions. $ ausearch --start 10:00:00 -c 'mysqld' --raw | audit2allow -M my-mysqld This policy allows mysqld writing into the tagged directories. Open the my_mysqld file: module my-mysqld 1.0; require { type mysqld_t; type default_t; class dir write; } #============= mysqld_t ============== allow mysqld_t default_t:dir write; Install the SELinux policy module: $ semodule -i my-mysqld.pp Restart the service. If you have a failure, check the journal log and follow the same procedure. If SELinux prevents mysql from creating a log file inside the directory. You can view all the violations by changing the SELinux mode to permissive and then running mysqld. All violations are logged in the journal log. After this run, you can generate a local policy module, install it, and switch SELinux back to enforcing mode. Follow this procedure: Unload the current local my-mysqld policy module: $ semodule -r my-mysqld You can put a single domain into permissive mode. Other domains on the system to remain in enforcing mode. Use semanage permissive with the -a parameter to change mysqld_t to permissive mode: $ semanage permissive -a mysqld_t Verify the mode change: $ semdule -l | grep permissive The output could be: ... permissive_mysqld_t ...

The default SELinux policy allows mysqld to write logs into a location tagged with var_log_t , which is the /var/log location. You can solve the issue with either of the following methods: Tag the /logs location properly Edit the SELinux policy to allow mysqld access to all directories. To tag the custom /logs location is the recommended method since it locks down access. Run the following commands to tag the custom location: $ semanage fcontext -a -t var_log_t /logs $ restorecon -v /logs You may not be able to change the /logs directory label. For example, other applications, with their own rules, use the same directory. To adjust the SELinux policy when a directory is shared, follow these steps: Create a local policy: ausearch -c 'mysqld' --raw | audit2allow -M my-mysqld This command generates the my-mysqld.te and the my-mysqld.pp files. The mysqld.te is the type enforcement policy file. The my-mysqld.pp is the policy module loaded as a binary file into the SELinux subsystem. An example of the my-myslqd.te file: module my-mysqld 1.0; require { *type mysqld_t*; type var_lib_t; *type default_t*; class file getattr; *class dir write*; } #============= mysqld_t ============== *allow mysqld_t default_t:dir write*; allow mysqld_t var_lib_t:file getattr; The policy contains rules for the custom data directory and the custom logs directory. We have set the proper labels for the data directory location, and applying this auto-generated policy would loosen our hardening by allowing mysqld to access var_lib_t tags. SELinux-generated events are converted to rules. A generated policy may contain rules for recent violations and include unrelated rules. Unrelated rules are generated from actions, such as changing the data directory location, that are not related to the logs directory. Add the --start parameter to use log events after a specific time to filter out the unwanted events. This parameter captures events when the time stamp is equal to the specified time or later. SELinux generates a policy for the current actions. $ ausearch --start 10:00:00 -c 'mysqld' --raw | audit2allow -M my-mysqld This policy allows mysqld writing into the tagged directories. Open the my_mysqld file: module my-mysqld 1.0; require { type mysqld_t; type default_t; class dir write; } #============= mysqld_t ============== allow mysqld_t default_t:dir write; Install the SELinux policy module: $ semodule -i my-mysqld.pp Restart the service. If you have a failure, check the journal log and follow the same procedure. If SELinux prevents mysql from creating a log file inside the directory. You can view all the violations by changing the SELinux mode to permissive and then running mysqld. All violations are logged in the journal log.

The first time a key is fetched from a keyring, the keyring_vault communicates with the Vault server to retrieve the key type and data. secret_mount_point_version information \u00b6 Implemented in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.23-14, the secret_mount_point_version can be either a 1 , 2 , AUTO , or the secret_mount_point_version parameter is not listed in the configuration file. Value Description 1 Works with KV Secrets Engine - Version 1 (kv) . When forming key operation URLs, the secret_mount_point is always used without any transformations. For example, to return a key named skey , the URL is /v1/ /skey 2 Works with KV Secrets Engine - Version 2 (kv) The initialization logic splits the secret_mount_point parameter into two parts: The mount_point_path - the mount path under which the Vault Server secret was created The directory_path - a virtual directory suffix that can be used to create virtual namespaces with the same real mount point For example, both the mount_point_path and the directory_path are needed to form key access URLs: /v1/<mount_point_path/data/ /skey AUTO An autodetection mechanism probes and determines if the secrets engine version is kv or kv-v2 and based on the outcome will either use the secret_mount_point as is, or split the secret_mount_point into two parts. Not listed If the secret_mount_point_version is not listed in the configuration file, the behavior is the same as AUTO . If you set the secret_mount_point_version to 2 but the path pointed by secret_mount_point is based on KV Secrets Engine - Version 1 (kv) , an error is reported and the plugin fails to initialize. If you set the secret_mount_point_version to 1 but the path pointed by secret_mount_point is based on KV Secrets Engine - Version 2 (kv-v2) , the plugin initialization succeeds but any MySQL keyring-related operations fail. Upgrading from 8.0.22-13 or earlier to 8.0.23-14 or later \u00b6 The keyring_vault plugin configuration files created before Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.23-14 work only with KV Secrets Engine - Version 1 (kv) and do not have the secret_mount_point_version parameter. After the upgrade to 8.0.23-14 or later, the secret_mount_point_version is implicitly considered AUTO and the information is probed and the secrets engine version is determined to 1 . Upgrading from Vault Secrets Engine Version 1 to Version 2 \u00b6 You can upgrade from the Vault Secrets Engine Version 1 to Version 2. Use either of the following methods: Set the secret_mount_point_version to AUTO or the variable is not set in the keyring_vault plugin configuration files in all Percona Servers. The AUTO value ensures the autodetection mechanism is invoked during the plugin initialization. Set the secret_mount_point_version to 2 to ensure that plugins do not initialize unless the kv to kv-v2 upgrade completes. Note The keyring_vault plugin that works with kv-v2 secret engines does not use the built-in key versioning capabilities. The keyring key versions are encoded into key names. KV Secret Engine considerations for upgrading from 5.7 to 8.0 \u00b6 When you upgrade from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.32 or older, you can only use KV Secrets Engine 1 (kv) . You can upgrade to any version of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0. Both the old keyring_vault plugin and new keyring_vault plugin work correctly with the existing Vault Server data under the existing keyring_vault plugin configuration file. If you upgrade from Percona Server for MySQL 5.7.33 or newer, you have the following options: If you are using KV Secrets Engine 1 (kv) you can upgrade with any version of Percona Server for MySQL 8.0. If you are using KV Secrets Engine 2 (kv-v2) you can upgrade with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.23 or newer. Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.23.14 is the first version of the 8.0 series which has the keyring_vault plugin that supports kv-v2 . A user-created key deletion is only possible with the use of the keyring_udf plugin and deletes the key from the in-memory hash map and the Vault server. You cannot delete system keys, such as the master key. This plugin supports the SQL interface for keyring key management described in the General-Purpose Keyring Key-Management Functions manual. The plugin library contains keyring user-defined functions which allow access to the internal keyring service functions. To enable the functions, you must enable the keyring_udf plugin: mysql > INSTALL PLUGIN keyring_udf SONAME 'keyring_udf.so' ; Note The keyring_udf plugin must be installed. Using the user-defined functions without the keyring_udf plugin generates an error. You must also create keyring encryption user-defined functions.

Then, you can load the plugins. The TokuDB storage engine was declared as deprecated in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . For more information, see the Percona blog post: Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . Introduction \u00b6 Update intensive applications can have their throughput limited by the random read capacity of the storage system. The cause of the throughput limit is the read-modify-write algorithm that MySQL uses to process update statements (read a row from the storage engine, apply the updates to it, write the new row back to the storage engine). To address this throughput limit, TokuDB provides an experimental fast update feature, which uses a different update algorithm. Update expressions of the SQL statement are encoded into tiny programs that are stored in an update Fractal Tree message. This update message is injected into the root of the Fractal Tree index. Eventually, these update messages reach a leaf node, where the update programs are applied to the row. Since messages are moved between Fractal Tree levels in batches, the cost of reading in the leaf node is amortized over many update messages. This feature is available for UPDATE and INSERT statements, and can be turned ON/OFF separately for them with use of two variables. Variable tokudb_enable_fast_update variable toggles fast updates for the UPDATE , and tokudb_enable_fast_upsert does the same for INSERT . Limitations \u00b6 Fast updates are activated instead of normal MySQL read-modify-write updates if the executed expression meets the number of conditions. fast updates can be activated for a statement or a mixed replication, a primary key must be defined for the involved table, both simple and compound primary keys are supported, and int , char or varchar are the allowed data types for them, updated fields should have Integer or char data type, fields that are part of any key should be not updated, clustering keys are not allowed, triggers should be not involved, supported update expressions should belong to one of the following types: x = constant x = x + constant x = x - constant x = if (x=0,0,x-1) x = x + values Usage Specifics and Examples \u00b6 Following example creates a table that associates event identifiers with their count: CREATE TABLE t ( event_id bigint unsigned NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY , event_count bigint unsigned NOT NULL ); Many graph applications that map onto relational tables can use duplicate key inserts and updates to maintain the graph. For example, one can update the meta-data associated with a link in the graph using duplicate key insertions. If the affected rows is not used by the application, then the insertion or update can be marked and executed as a fast insertion or a fast update. Insertion example \u00b6 If it is not known if the event identifier (represented by event_id) already exists in the table, then INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE ... statement can insert it if not existing, or increment its event_count otherwise.

The cause of the throughput limit is the read-modify-write algorithm that MySQL uses to process update statements (read a row from the storage engine, apply the updates to it, write the new row back to the storage engine). To address this throughput limit, TokuDB provides an experimental fast update feature, which uses a different update algorithm. Update expressions of the SQL statement are encoded into tiny programs that are stored in an update Fractal Tree message. This update message is injected into the root of the Fractal Tree index. Eventually, these update messages reach a leaf node, where the update programs are applied to the row. Since messages are moved between Fractal Tree levels in batches, the cost of reading in the leaf node is amortized over many update messages.

Installing TokuBackup plugin\u2026 INFO: Successfully installed TokuBackup plugin. Making a Backup \u00b6 To run Percona TokuBackup , the backup destination directory must exist, be writable and owned by the same user under which MySQL server is running (usually mysql ) and empty. Once this directory is created, the backup can be run using the following command: mysql > set tokudb_backup_dir = '/path_to_empty_directory' ; Note Setting the tokudb_backup_dir variable automatically starts the backup process to the specified directory. Percona TokuBackup will take full backup each time, currently there is no incremental backup option If you get any error on this step (e.g. caused by some misconfiguration), the Reporting Errors section explains how to find out the reason. Restoring From Backup \u00b6 Percona TokuBackup does not have any functionality for restoring a backup. You can use rsync or cp to restore the files. You should check that the restored files have the correct ownership and permissions. NOTE : Make sure that the datadir is empty and that MySQL server is shut down before restoring from backup. You can\u2019t restore to a datadir of a running mysqld instance (except when importing a partial backup). The following example shows how you might use the rsync command to restore the backup: $ rsync -avrP /data/backup/ /var/lib/mysql/ Since attributes of files are preserved, in most cases you will need to change their ownership to mysql before starting the database server. Otherwise, the files will be owned by the user who created the backup. $ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql If you have changed default TokuDB data directory (tokudb_data_dir) or TokuDB log directory (tokudb_log_dir) or both of them, you will see separate folders for each setting in backup directory after taking backup. You\u2019ll need to restore each folder separately: $ rsync -avrP /data/backup/mysql_data_dir/ /var/lib/mysql/ $ rsync -avrP /data/backup/tokudb_data_dir/ /path/to/original/tokudb_data_dir/ $ rsync -avrP /data/backup/tokudb_log_dir/ /path/to/original/tokudb_log_dir/ $ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql $ chown -R mysql:mysql /path/to/original/tokudb_data_dir $ chown -R mysql:mysql /path/to/original/tokudb_log_dir Advanced Configuration \u00b6 Monitoring Progress \u00b6 TokuBackup updates the PROCESSLIST state while the backup is in progress. You can see the output by running SHOW PROCESSLIST or SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST . Excluding Source Files \u00b6 You can exclude certain files and directories based on a regular expression set in the tokudb_backup_exclude session variable. If the source file name matches the excluded regular expression, then the source file is excluded from backup. For example, to exclude all lost+found directories from backup, use the following command: mysql > SET tokudb_backup_exclude = '/lost\\\\+found($|/)' ; Note The server pid file is excluded by default. If you\u2019re providing your own additions to the exclusions and have the pid file in the default location, you will need to add the mysqld_safe.pid entry. Throttling Backup Rate \u00b6 You can throttle the backup rate using the tokudb_backup_throttle session-level variable. This variable throttles the write rate in bytes per second of the backup to prevent TokuBackup from crowding out other jobs in the system. The default and max value is 18446744073709551615. mysql > SET tokudb_backup_throttle = 1000000 ; Restricting Backup Target \u00b6 You can restrict the location of the destination directory where the backups can be located using the tokudb_backup_allowed_prefix system-level variable. Attempts to backup to a location outside of the specified directory or its children will result in an error. The default is null , backups have no restricted locations. This read-only variable can be set in the my.cnf configuration file and displayed with the SHOW VARIABLES command: mysql > SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'tokudb_backup_allowed_prefix' ; The output could be: +------------------------------+-----------+ | Variable_name | Value | +------------------------------+-----------+ | tokudb_backup_allowed_prefix | /dumpdir | +------------------------------+-----------+ Reporting Errors \u00b6 Percona TokuBackup uses two variables to capture errors. They are tokudb_backup_last_error and tokudb_backup_last_error_string. When TokuBackup encounters an error, these will report on the error number and the error string respectively. For example, the following output shows these parameters following an attempted backup to a directory that was not empty: mysql > SET tokudb_backup_dir = '/tmp/backupdir' ; The output could be: ERROR 1231 (42000): Variable 'tokudb_backup_dir' can't be set to the value of '/tmp/backupdir' mysql> SELECT @@tokudb_backup_last_error; +----------------------------+ | @@tokudb_backup_last_error | +----------------------------+ | 17 | +----------------------------+ mysql > SELECT @@ tokudb_backup_last_error_string ; The output could be: +---------------------------------------------------+ | @@tokudb_backup_last_error_string | +---------------------------------------------------+ | tokudb backup couldn't create needed directories. | +---------------------------------------------------+ Using TokuDB Hot Backup for Replication \u00b6 TokuDB Hot Backup makes a transactionally consistent copy of the TokuDB files while applications read and write to these files. The TokuDB hot backup library intercepts certain system calls that writes files and duplicates the writes on backup files while copying files to the backup directory. The copied files contain the same content as the original files. TokuDB Hot Backup also has an API. This API includes the start capturing and stop capturing commands. The \u201ccapturing\u201d command starts the process, when a portion of a file is copied to the backup location, and this portion is changed, these changes are also applied to the backup location. Replication often uses backup replication to create replicas. You must know the last executed global transaction identifier (GTID) or binary log position both for the replica and source configuration. To lock tables, use FLUSH TABLE WITH READ LOCK or use the smart locks like LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP or LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP . During the copy process, the binlog is flushed, and the changes are copied to backup by the \u201ccapturing\u201d mechanism. After everything has been copied, and the \u201ccapturing\u201d mechanism is still running, use the LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP . After this statement is executed, the binlog is flushed, the changes are captured, and any queries that could change the binlog position or executed GTID are blocked. After this command, we can stop capturing and retrieve the last executed GTID or binlog log position and unlock the binlog. After a backup is taken, there are the following files in the backup directory: tokubackup_slave_info tokubackup_binlog_info These files contain information for replica and source. You can use this information to start a new replica from the source or replica. The SHOW MASTER STATUS and SHOW SLAVE STATUS commands provide the information. Important As of MySQL 8.0.22, the SHOW SLAVE STATUS statement is deprecated. Use SHOW REPLICA STATUS instead. In specific binlog formats, a binary log event can contain statements that produce temporary tables on the replica side, and the result of further statements may depend on the temporary table content. Typically, temporary tables are not selected for backup because they are created in a separate directory. A backup created with temporary tables created by binlog events can cause issues when restored because the temporary tables are not restored. The data may be inconsistent. The following system variables \u2013tokudb-backup-safe-slave, which enables or disables the safe-slave mode, and \u2013tokudb-backup-safe-slave-timeout, which defines the maximum amount of time in seconds to wait until temporary tables disappear. The safe-slave mode, when used with LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP , the replica SQL thread is stopped and checked to see if temporary tables produced by the replica exist or do not exist. If temporary tables exist, the replica SQL thread is restarted until there are no temporary tables or a defined timeout is reached. You should not use this option for group-replication. Create a Backup with a Timestamp \u00b6 If you plan to store more than one backup in a location, you should add a timestamp to the backup directory name. A sample Bash script has this information: #!/bin/bash tm=$(date \"+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S\"); backup_dir=$PWD/backup/$tm; mkdir -p $backup_dir; bin/mysql -uroot -e \"set tokudb_backup_dir='$backup_dir'\" Limitations and known issues \u00b6 You must disable InnoDB asynchronous IO if backing up InnoDB tables with TokuBackup . Otherwise you will have inconsistent, unrecoverable backups. The appropriate setting is innodb_use_native_aio=0 . To be able to run Point-In-Time-Recovery you\u2019ll need to manually get the binary log position. Transactional storage engines ( TokuDB and InnoDB ) will perform recovery on the backup copy of the database when it is first started. Tables using non-transactional storage engines ( MyISAM ) are not locked during the copy and may report issues when starting up the backup. It is best to avoid operations that modify these tables at the end of a hot backup operation (adding/changing users, stored procedures, etc.). The database is copied locally to the path specified in /path/to/backup . This folder must exist, be writable, be empty, and contain enough space for a full copy of the database. TokuBackup always makes a backup of the MySQL datadir and optionally the tokudb_data_dir, tokudb_log_dir, and the binary log folder. The latter three are only backed up separately if they are not the same as or contained in the MySQL datadir. None of these three folders can be a parent of the MySQL datadir. No other directory structures are supported. All InnoDB , MyISAM , and other storage engine files must be within the MySQL datadir. TokuBackup does not follow symbolic links. TokuBackup does not backup MySQL configuration file(s). TokuBackup does not backup tablespaces if they are out of datadir. Due to upstream bug #80183 , TokuBackup can\u2019t recover backed-up table data if backup was taken while running OPTIMIZE TABLE or ALTER TABLE ... TABLESPACE .

You can\u2019t restore to a datadir of a running mysqld instance (except when importing a partial backup). The following example shows how you might use the rsync command to restore the backup: $ rsync -avrP /data/backup/ /var/lib/mysql/ Since attributes of files are preserved, in most cases you will need to change their ownership to mysql before starting the database server. Otherwise, the files will be owned by the user who created the backup. $ chown -R mysql:mysql /var/lib/mysql If you have changed default TokuDB data directory (tokudb_data_dir) or TokuDB log directory (tokudb_log_dir) or both of them, you will see separate folders for each setting in backup directory after taking backup.

The TokuDB hot backup library intercepts certain system calls that writes files and duplicates the writes on backup files while copying files to the backup directory. The copied files contain the same content as the original files. TokuDB Hot Backup also has an API. This API includes the start capturing and stop capturing commands. The \u201ccapturing\u201d command starts the process, when a portion of a file is copied to the backup location, and this portion is changed, these changes are also applied to the backup location. Replication often uses backup replication to create replicas. You must know the last executed global transaction identifier (GTID) or binary log position both for the replica and source configuration. To lock tables, use FLUSH TABLE WITH READ LOCK or use the smart locks like LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP or LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP . During the copy process, the binlog is flushed, and the changes are copied to backup by the \u201ccapturing\u201d mechanism. After everything has been copied, and the \u201ccapturing\u201d mechanism is still running, use the LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP . After this statement is executed, the binlog is flushed, the changes are captured, and any queries that could change the binlog position or executed GTID are blocked. After this command, we can stop capturing and retrieve the last executed GTID or binlog log position and unlock the binlog. After a backup is taken, there are the following files in the backup directory: tokubackup_slave_info tokubackup_binlog_info These files contain information for replica and source. You can use this information to start a new replica from the source or replica. The SHOW MASTER STATUS and SHOW SLAVE STATUS commands provide the information. Important As of MySQL 8.0.22, the SHOW SLAVE STATUS statement is deprecated. Use SHOW REPLICA STATUS instead. In specific binlog formats, a binary log event can contain statements that produce temporary tables on the replica side, and the result of further statements may depend on the temporary table content. Typically, temporary tables are not selected for backup because they are created in a separate directory. A backup created with temporary tables created by binlog events can cause issues when restored because the temporary tables are not restored. The data may be inconsistent. The following system variables \u2013tokudb-backup-safe-slave, which enables or disables the safe-slave mode, and \u2013tokudb-backup-safe-slave-timeout, which defines the maximum amount of time in seconds to wait until temporary tables disappear. The safe-slave mode, when used with LOCK BINLOG FOR BACKUP , the replica SQL thread is stopped and checked to see if temporary tables produced by the replica exist or do not exist. If temporary tables exist, the replica SQL thread is restarted until there are no temporary tables or a defined timeout is reached.

To be able to run Point-In-Time-Recovery you\u2019ll need to manually get the binary log position. Transactional storage engines ( TokuDB and InnoDB ) will perform recovery on the backup copy of the database when it is first started. Tables using non-transactional storage engines ( MyISAM ) are not locked during the copy and may report issues when starting up the backup. It is best to avoid operations that modify these tables at the end of a hot backup operation (adding/changing users, stored procedures, etc.). The database is copied locally to the path specified in /path/to/backup . This folder must exist, be writable, be empty, and contain enough space for a full copy of the database. TokuBackup always makes a backup of the MySQL datadir and optionally the tokudb_data_dir, tokudb_log_dir, and the binary log folder. The latter three are only backed up separately if they are not the same as or contained in the MySQL datadir. None of these three folders can be a parent of the MySQL datadir.

For more information, see the Percona blog post: Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . Percona Server for MySQL has an option to automatically analyze tables in the background based on a measured change in data. This has been done by implementing the background job manager that can perform operations on a background thread. Background Jobs \u00b6 Background jobs and schedule are transient in nature and are not persisted anywhere. Any currently running job will be terminated on shutdown and all scheduled jobs will be forgotten about on server restart. There can\u2019t be two jobs on the same table scheduled or running at any one point in time. If you manually invoke an ANALYZE TABLE that conflicts with either a pending or running job, the running job will be canceled and the users task will run immediately in the foreground. All the scheduled and running background jobs can be viewed by querying the TOKUDB_BACKGROUND_JOB_STATUS table. New tokudb_analyze_in_background variable has been implemented in order to control if the ANALYZE TABLE will be dispatched to the background process or if it will be running in the foreground. To control the function of ANALYZE TABLE a new tokudb_analyze_mode variable has been implemented. This variable offers options to cancel any running or scheduled job on the specified table ( TOKUDB_ANALYZE_CANCEL ), use existing analysis algorithm ( TOKUDB_ANALYZE_STANDARD ), or to recount the logical rows in table and update persistent count ( TOKUDB_ANALYZE_RECOUNT_ROWS ). TOKUDB_ANALYZE_RECOUNT_ROWS is a new mechanism that is used to perform a logical recount of all rows in a table and persist that as the basis value for the table row estimate. This mode was added for tables that have been upgraded from an older version of TokuDB that only reported physical row counts and never had a proper logical row count. Newly created tables/partitions will begin counting logical rows correctly from their creation and should not need to be recounted unless some odd edge condition causes the logical count to become inaccurate over time. This analysis mode has no effect on the table cardinality counts. It will take the currently set session values for tokudb_analyze_in_background, and tokudb_analyze_throttle. Changing the global or session instances of these values after scheduling will have no effect on the job. Any background job, both pending and running, can be canceled by setting the tokudb_analyze_mode to TOKUDB_ANALYZE_CANCEL and issuing the ANALYZE TABLE on the table for which you want to cancel all the jobs for. Auto analysis \u00b6 To implement the background analysis and gathering of cardinality statistics on a TokuDB tables new delta value is now maintained in memory for each TokuDB table. This value is not persisted anywhere and it is reset to 0 on a server start. It is incremented for each INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE command and ignores the impact of transactions (rollback specifically). When this delta value exceeds the tokudb_auto_analyze percentage of rows in the table an analysis is performed according to the current session\u2019s settings. Other analysis for this table will be disabled until this analysis completes. When this analysis completes, the delta is reset to 0 to begin recalculating table changes for the next potential analysis. Status values are now reported to server immediately upon completion of any analysis (previously new status values were not used until the table has been closed and re-opened). Half-time direction reversal of analysis has been implemented, meaning that if a tokudb_analyze_time is in effect and the analysis has not reached the half way point of the index by the time tokudb_analyze_time/2 has been reached: it will stop the forward progress and restart the analysis from the last/rightmost row in the table, progressing leftwards and keeping/adding to the status information accumulated from the first half of the scan. For small ratios of table_rows / tokudb_auto_analyze, auto analysis will be run for almost every change. The trigger formula is: if (table_delta >= ((table_rows \\* tokudb_auto_analyze) / 100)) then run ANALYZE TABLE . If a user manually invokes an ANALYZE TABLE and tokudb_auto_analyze is enabled and there are no conflicting background jobs, the users ANALYZE TABLE will behave exactly as if the delta level has been exceeded in that the analysis is executed and delta reset to 0 upon completion.

The tokudb_enabled option and the tokudb_backup_enabled option control the state of the plugins and have a default setting of FALSE. The result of attempting to load the plugins are the plugins fail to initialize and print a deprecation message. We recommend Migrating the data to the MyRocks storage engine . To enable the plugins to migrate to another storage engine, set the tokudb_enabled and tokudb_backup_enabled options to TRUE in your my.cnf file and restart your server instance. Then, you can load the plugins. The TokuDB storage engine was declared as deprecated in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . For more information, see the Percona blog post: Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . This section contains frequently asked questions regarding TokuDB and related software. Transactional Operations \u00b6 What transactional operations does TokuDB support? \u00b6 TokuDB supports BEGIN TRANSACTION , END TRANSACTION , COMMIT , ROLLBACK , SAVEPOINT , and RELEASE SAVEPOINT . TokuDB and the File System \u00b6 How can I determine which files belong to the various tables and indexes in my schemas? \u00b6 The tokudb_file_map plugin lists all Fractal Tree Indexes and their corresponding data files. The internal_file_name is the actual file name (in the data folder). mysqlSELECT * FROM information_schema . tokudb_file_map ; The output could be: +--------------------------+---------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+------------------------+ | dictionary_name | internal_file_name | table_schema | table_name | table_dictionary_name | +--------------------------+---------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+------------------------+ | ./test/tmc-key-idx_col2 | ./_test_tmc_key_idx_col2_a_14.tokudb | test | tmc | key_idx_col2 | | ./test/tmc-main | ./_test_tmc_main_9_14.tokudb | test | tmc | main | | ./test/tmc-status | ./_test_tmc_status_8_14.tokudb | test | tmc | status | +--------------------------+---------------------------------------+---------------+-------------+------------------------+ Full Disks \u00b6 What happens when the disk system fills up? \u00b6 The disk system may fill up during bulk load operations, such as LOAD DATA IN FILE or CREATE INDEX , or during incremental operations like INSERT . In the bulk case, running out of disk space will cause the statement to fail with ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 1 from storage engine . The temporary space used by the bulk loader will be released. If this happens, you can use a separate physical disk for the temporary files (for more information, see tokudb_tmp_dir). If server runs out of free space TokuDB will assert the server to prevent data corruption to existing data files. Otherwise, disk space can run low during non-bulk operations. When available space is below a user-configurable reserve (5% by default) inserts are prevented and transactions that perform inserts are aborted. If the disk becomes completely full then TokuDB will freeze until some disk space is made available. Details about the disk system: There is a free-space reserve requirement, which is a user-configurable parameter given as a percentage of the total space in the file system. The default reserve is five percent. This value is available in the global variable tokudb_fs_reserve_percent. We recommend that this reserve be at least half the size of your physical memory. TokuDB polls the file system every five seconds to determine how much free space is available. If the free space dips below the reserve, then further table inserts are prohibited. Any transaction that attempts to insert rows will be aborted. Inserts are re-enabled when twice the reserve is available in the file system (so freeing a small amount of disk storage will not be sufficient to resume inserts). Warning messages are sent to the system error log when free space dips below twice the reserve and again when free space dips below the reserve. Even with inserts prohibited it is still possible for the file system to become completely full. For example this can happen because another storage engine or another application consumes disk space. If the file system becomes completely full, then TokuDB will freeze. It will not crash, but it will not respond to most SQL commands until some disk space is made available. When TokuDB is frozen in this state, it will still respond to the following command: SHOW ENGINE TokuDB STATUS ; The output could be: Make disk space available will allow the storage engine to continue running, but inserts will still be prohibited until twice the reserve is free. Note Engine status displays a field indicating if disk free space is above twice the reserve, below twice the reserve, or below the reserve. It will also display a special warning if the disk is completely full. In order to make space available on this system you can: Add some disk space to the filesystem. Delete some non-TokuDB files manually. If the disk is not completely full, you may be able to reclaim space by aborting any transactions that are very old. Old transactions can consume large volumes of disk space in the recovery log. If the disk is not completely full, you can drop indexes or drop tables from your TokuDB databases. Deleting large numbers of rows from an existing table and then closing the table may free some space, but it may not. Deleting rows may simply leave unused space (available for new inserts) inside TokuDB data files rather than shrink the files (internal fragmentation). The fine print: The TokuDB storage engine can use up to three separate file systems simultaneously, one each for the data, the recovery log, and the error log. All three are monitored, and if any one of the three falls below the relevant threshold then a warning message will be issued and inserts may be prohibited. Warning messages to the error log are not repeated unless available disk space has been above the relevant threshold for at least one minute. This prevents excess messages in the error log if the disk free space is fluctuating around the limit. Even if there are no other storage engines or other applications running, it is still possible for TokuDB to consume more disk space when operations such as row delete and query are performed, or when checkpoints are taken. This can happen because TokuDB can write cached information when it is time-efficient rather than when inserts are issued by the application, because operations in addition to insert (such as delete) create log entries, and also because of internal fragmentation of TokuDB data files. The tokudb_fs_reserve_percent variable can not be changed once the system has started. It can only be set in my.cnf or on the mysqld command line. Backup \u00b6 How do I back up a system with TokuDB tables? \u00b6 Taking backups with Percona TokuBackup \u00b6 TokuDB is capable of performing online backups with Percona TokuBackup. To perform a backup, execute backup to '/path/to/backup'; . This will create backup of the server and return when complete. The backup can be used by another server using a copy of the binaries on the source server. You can view the progress of the backup by executing SHOW PROCESSLIST; . TokuBackup produces a copy of your running MySQL server that is consistent at the end time of the backup process. The thread copying files from source to destination can be throttled by setting the tokudb_backup_throttle server variable. For more information check Percona TokuBackup. The following conditions apply: * Currently, *TokuBackup* only supports tables using the *TokuDB* storage engine and the *MyISAM* tables in the `mysql` database. !!! warning You must disable *InnoDB* asynchronous IO if backing up *InnoDB* tables via *TokuBackup* utility. Otherwise you will have inconsistent, unrecoverable backups. The appropriate setting is innodb_use_native_aio to `0`. * Transactional storage engines (*TokuDB* and *InnoDB*) will perform recovery on the backup copy of the database when it is first started. * Tables using non-transactional storage engines (*MyISAM*) are not locked during the copy and may report issues when starting up the backup. It is best to avoid operations that modify these tables at the end of a hot backup operation (adding/changing users, stored procedures, etc.). * The database is copied locally to the path specified in `/path/to/backup`. This folder must exist, be writable, be empty, and contain enough space for a full copy of the database. * *TokuBackup* always makes a backup of the *MySQL* `datadir` and optionally the tokudb_data_dir, tokudb_log_dir, and the binary log folder. The latter three are only backed up separately if they are not the same as or contained in the *MySQL* `datadir`. None of these three folders can be a parent of the *MySQL* `datadir`. * A folder is created in the given backup destination for each of the source folders. * No other directory structures are supported. All *InnoDB*, *MyISAM*, and other storage engine files must be within the *MySQL* `datadir`. * *TokuBackup* does not follow symbolic links. Other options for taking backups \u00b6 TokuDB tables are represented in the file system with dictionary files, log files, and metadata files. A consistent copy of all of these files must be made during a backup. Copying the files while they may be modified by a running MySQL may result in an inconsistent copy of the database. LVM snapshots may be used to get a consistent snapshot of all of the TokuDB files. The LVM snapshot may then be backed up at leisure. The SELECT INTO OUTFILE statement or mysqldump application may also be used to get a logical backup of the database. References \u00b6 The MySQL 5.5 reference manual describes several backup methods and strategies. In addition, we recommend reading the backup and recovery chapter in High Performance MySQL, 3 rd Edition , by Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, and Vadim Tkachenko, Copyright 2012, O\u2019Reilly Media. Cold Backup \u00b6 When MySQL is shut down, a copy of the MySQL data directory, the TokuDB data directory, and the TokuDB log directory can be made. In the simplest configuration, the TokuDB files are stored in the MySQL data directory with all of other MySQL files. One merely has to back up this directory. Hot Backup using mylvmbackup \u00b6 The mylvmbackup utility, located on Launchpad , works with TokuDB . It does all of the magic required to get consistent copies of all of the MySQL tables, including MyISAM tables, InnoDB tables, etc., creates the LVM snapshots, and backs up the snapshots. Logical Snapshots \u00b6 A logical snapshot of the databases uses a SQL statements to retrieve table rows and restore them. When used within a transaction, a consistent snapshot of the database can be taken. This method can be used to export tables from one database server and import them into another server. The SELECT INTO OUTFILE statement is used to take a logical snapshot of a database. The LOAD DATA INFILE statement is used to load the table data. Please see the MySQL 5.6 reference manual for details. Note Please do not use the mysqlhotcopy to back up TokuDB tables. This script is incompatible with TokuDB . Missing Log Files \u00b6 What do I do if I delete my logs files or they are otherwise missing? \u00b6 You\u2019ll need to recover from a backup. It is essential that the log files be present in order to restart the database. Isolation Levels \u00b6 What is the default isolation level for TokuDB? \u00b6 It is repeatable-read (MVCC). How can I change the isolation level? \u00b6 TokuDB supports repeatable-read, serializable, read-uncommitted and read-committed isolation levels (other levels are not supported). TokuDB employs pessimistic locking, and aborts a transaction when a lock conflict is detected. To guarantee that lock conflicts do not occur, use repeatable-read, read-uncommitted or read-committed isolation level. Lock Wait Timeout Exceeded \u00b6 Why do my MySQL clients get lock timeout errors for my update queries? And what should my application do when it gets these errors? \u00b6 Updates can get lock timeouts if some other transaction is holding a lock on the rows being updated for longer than the TokuDB lock timeout. You may want to increase the this timeout. If an update deadlocks, then the transaction should abort and retry. For more information on diagnosing locking issues, see Lock Visualization in TokuDB . Row Size \u00b6 What is the maximum row size? \u00b6 The maximum row size is 32 MiB. NFS & CIFS \u00b6 Can the data directories reside on a disk that is NFS or CIFS mounted? \u00b6 Yes, we do have customers in production with NFS & CIFS volumes today. However, both of these disk types can pose a challenge to performance and data integrity due to their complexity. If you\u2019re seeking performance, the switching infrastructure and protocols of a traditional network were not conceptualized for low response times and can be very difficult to troubleshoot. If you\u2019re concerned with data integrity, the possible data caching at the NFS level can cause inconsistencies between the logs and data files that may never be detected in the event of a crash. If you are thinking of using a NFS or CIFS mount, we would recommend that you use synchronous mount options, which are available from the NFS mount man page, but these settings may decrease performance. For further discussion please look here . Using Other Storage Engines \u00b6 Can the MyISAM and InnoDB Storage Engines be used? \u00b6 MyISAM and InnoDB can be used directly in conjunction with TokuDB . Please note that you should not over-commit memory between InnoDB and TokuDB . The total memory assigned to both caches must be less than physical memory. Can the Federated Storage Engines be used? \u00b6 The Federated Storage Engine can also be used, however it is disabled by default in MySQL . It can be enabled by either running mysqld with --federated as a command line parameter, or by putting federated in the [mysqld] section of the my.cnf file. For more information see the MySQL 8.0 Reference Manual: FEDERATED Storage Engine . Using MySQL Patches with TokuDB \u00b6 Can I use MySQL source code patches with TokuDB? \u00b6 Yes, but you need to apply Percona patches as well as your patches to MySQL to build a binary that works with the Percona Fractal Tree library. Truncate Table vs Delete from Table \u00b6 Which is faster, TRUNCATE TABLE or DELETE FROM TABLE? \u00b6 Use TRUNCATE TABLE whenever possible. A table truncation runs in constant time, whereas a DELETE FROM TABLE requires a row-by-row deletion and thus runs in time linear to the table size. Foreign Keys \u00b6 Does TokuDB enforce foreign key constraints? \u00b6 No. TokuDB ignores foreign key declarations. Dropping Indexes \u00b6 Is dropping an index in TokuDB hot? \u00b6 No, the table is locked for the amount of time it takes the file system to delete the file associated with the index.","title":"Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"tokudb/tokudb_faq.html#frequently-asked-questions","text":"Important Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19 , the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported.

Moving TokuDB data files to a location outside of the default MySQL datadir \u00b6 TokuDB uses the location specified by the tokudb_data_dir variable for all of its data files. If the tokudb_data_dir variable is not explicitly set, TokuDB will use the location specified by the servers datadir for these files.

TokuDB data files may be moved to other locations with symlinks left behind in their place. If those symlinks refer to files on other physical data volumes, the tokudb_fs_reserve_percent monitor will not traverse the symlink and monitor the real location for adequate space in the file system. To safely move your TokuDB data files: Shut the server down cleanly. Change the tokudb_data_dir in your my.cnf configuration file to the location where you wish to store your TokuDB data files.

Improved table renaming functionality \u00b6 When you rename a TokuDB table via SQL, the data files on disk keep their original names and only the mapping in the Percona FT directory file is changed to map the new dictionary name to the original internal file names. This makes it difficult to quickly match database/table/index names to their actual files on disk, requiring you to use the refTOKUDB_FILE_MAP table to cross reference. The tokudb_dir_per_db variable is implemented to address this issue. When tokudb_dir_per_db is enabled ( ON by default), this is no longer the case. When you rename a table, the mapping in the Percona FT directory file will be updated and the files will be renamed on disk to reflect the new table name. Improved directory layout functionality \u00b6 Many users have had issues with managing the huge volume of individual files that TokuDB and Percona FT use. The tokudb_dir_per_db variable addresses this issue. When tokudb_dir_per_db variable is enabled ( ON by default), all new tables and indices will be placed within their corresponding database directory within the tokudb_data_dir or server datadir. If you have tokudb_data_dir variable set to something other than the server datadir, TokuDB will create a directory matching the name of the database, but upon dropping of the database, this directory will remain behind. Existing table files will not be automatically relocated to their corresponding database directory. You can easily move a tables data files into the new scheme and proper database directory with a few steps: mysql > SET GLOBAL tokudb_dir_per_db = true ; mysql > RENAME TABLE < table > TO < tmp_table > ; mysql > RENAME TABLE < tmp_table > TO < table > ; Note Two renames are needed because MySQL doesn\u2019t allow you to rename a table to itself. The first rename, renames the table to the temporary name and moves the table files into the owning database directory. The second rename sets the table name back to the original name. Tables can also be renamed/moved across databases and will be placed correctly into the corresponding database directory. Warning You must be careful with renaming tables in case you have used any tricks to create symlinks of the database directories on different storage volumes, the move is not a simple directory move on the same volume but a physical copy across volumes. This can take quite some time and prevent access to the table being moved during the copy.

This document lists the different types of TokuDB and Percona Fractal Tree files, explains their purpose, shows their location and how to move them around. tokudb.environment \u00b6 This file is the root of the Percona FT file set and contains various bits of metadata about the system, such as creation times, current file format versions, etc. Percona FT will create/expect this file in the directory specified by the MySQL datadir. tokudb.rollback \u00b6 Every transaction within Percona FT maintains its own transaction rollback log. These logs are stored together within a single Percona FT dictionary file and take up space within the Percona FT cachetable (just like any other Percona FT dictionary). The transaction rollback logs will undo any changes made by a transaction if the transaction is explicitly rolled back, or rolled back via recovery as a result of an uncommitted transaction when a crash occurs. Percona FT will create/expect this file in the directory specified by the MySQL datadir. tokudb.directory \u00b6 Percona FT maintains a mapping of a dictionary name (example: sbtest.sbtest1.main ) to an internal file name (example: _sbtest_sbtest1_main_xx_x_xx.tokudb ). This mapping is stored within this single Percona FT dictionary file and takes up space within the Percona FT cachetable just like any other Percona FT dictionary. Percona FT will create/expect this file in the directory specified by the MySQL datadir. Dictionary files \u00b6 TokuDB dictionary (data) files store actual user data. For each MySQL table there will be: One status dictionary that contains metadata about the table. One main dictionary that stores the full primary key (an imaginary key is used if one was not explicitly specified) and full row data. One key dictionary for each additional key/index on the table. These are typically named: _<database>_<table>_<key>_<internal_txn_id>.tokudb Percona FT creates/expects these files in the directory specified by tokudb_data_dir if set, otherwise the MySQL datadir is used. Recovery log files \u00b6 The Percona FT recovery log records every operation that modifies a Percona FT dictionary. Periodically, the system will take a snapshot of the system called a checkpoint. This checkpoint ensures that the modifications recorded within the Percona FT recovery logs have been applied to the appropriate dictionary files up to a known point in time and synced to disk. These files have a rolling naming convention, but use: log<log_file_number>.tokulog<log_file_format_version> . Percona FT creates/expects these files in the directory specified by tokudb_log_dir if set, otherwise the MySQL datadir is used. Percona FT does not track what log files should or shouldn\u2019t be present. Upon startup, it discovers the logs in the log directory, and replays them in order. If the wrong logs are present, the recovery aborts and possibly damages the dictionaries. Temporary files \u00b6 Percona FT might need to create some temporary files in order to perform some operations. When the bulk loader is active, these temporary files might grow to be quite large. As different operations start and finish, the files will come and go. There are no temporary files left behind upon a clean shutdown, Percona FT creates/expects these files in the directory specified by tokudb_tmp_dir if set. If not, the tokudb_data_dir is used if set, otherwise the MySQL datadir is used. Lock files \u00b6 Percona FT uses lock files to prevent multiple processes from accessing and writing to the files in the assorted Percona FT functionality areas. Each lock file will be in the same directory as the file(s) that it is protecting. These empty files are only used as semaphores across processes. They are safe to delete/ignore as long as no server instances are currently running and using the data set. __tokudb_lock_dont_delete_me_environment __tokudb_lock_dont_delete_me_recovery __tokudb_lock_dont_delete_me_logs __tokudb_lock_dont_delete_me_data __tokudb_lock_dont_delete_me_temp Percona FT validates its data set.

This type of index enhances the traditional B-tree data structure used in other database engines, and optimizes performance for modern hardware and data sets. Background \u00b6 The B-tree data structure was optimized for large blocks of data but the performance is limited by I/O bandwidth. The size of a production database generally exceeds available main memory. Most leaves in a tree are stored on disk, not in RAM. If a leaf is not in main memory inserting information requires a disk I/O operation. Continually adding RAM to keep pace with the data growth is too expensive. Buffers \u00b6 Like a B-tree structure, a fractal tree index is a tree data structure, but each node has buffers that allow messages to be stored. Insertions, deletions, and updates are inserted into the buffers as messages. Buffers let each disk operation be more efficient by writing large amounts of data. Buffers also avoid the common B-tree scenario when disk writes change only a small amount of data. In fractal tree indexes, non-leaf (internal) nodes have child nodes. The number of child nodes is variable and based on a pre-defined range. When data is inserted or deleted from a node, the number of child nodes changes. Internal nodes may join or split to maintain the defined range. When the buffer is full, the messages are flushed to children nodes. Fractal tree index data structure involves the same algorithmic complexity as B-tree queries. There is no data loss because the queries follow the path from the root to leaf and pass through all messages. A query knows the current state of data even if changes have not been propagated to the corresponding leaves. Each message is stamped with a unique message sequence number (MSN) when the message is stored in a non-leaf node message buffer. The MSN maintains the order of messages and ensures the messages are only applied once to leaf nodes when the leaf node is updated by messages. Buffers are also serialized to disk, messages in internal nodes are not lost in the case of a crash or outage.

Compression lowers cost by reducing the amount of storage required and frees up disk space for additional indexes to achieve improved query performance. Depending on the compressibility of the data, we have seen compression ratios up to 25x for high compression. Compression can also lead to improved performance since less data needs to be read from and written to disk. Fast Insertions and Deletions TokuDB\u2019s Fractal Tree technology enables fast indexed insertions and deletions. Fractal Trees match B-trees in their indexing sweet spot (sequential data) and are up to two orders of magnitude faster for random data with high cardinality. Eliminates Replica Lag *TokuDB* replication replicas can be configured to process the replication stream with virtually no read IO. Uniqueness checking is performed on the *TokuDB* source and can be skipped on all *TokuDB* replica. Also, row based replication ensures that all before and after row images are captured in the binary logs, so the *TokuDB* replicas can harness the power of Fractal Tree indexes and bypass traditional read-modify-write behavior. This \u201cRead Free Replication\u201d ensures that replication replicas do not fall behind the source and can be used for read scaling, backups, and disaster recovery, without sharding, expensive hardware, or limits on what can be replicated. Hot Index Creation *TokuDB* allows the addition of indexes to an existing table while inserts and queries are being performed on that table. This means that *MySQL* can be run continuously with no blocking of queries or insertions while indexes are added and eliminates the down-time that index changes would otherwise require. Hot Column Addition, Deletion, Expansion and Rename *TokuDB* allows the addition of new columns to an existing table, the deletion of existing columns from an existing table, the expansion of `char`, `varchar`, `varbinary`, and `integer` type columns in an existing table, and the renaming of an existing column while inserts and queries are being performed on that table. Online (Hot) Backup The *TokuDB* can create backups of online database servers without downtime. Fast Indexing In practice, slow indexing often leads users to choose a smaller number of sub-optimal indexes in order to keep up with incoming data rates. These sub-optimal indexes result in disproportionately slower queries, since the difference in speed between a query with an index and the same query when no index is available can be many orders of magnitude. Thus, fast indexing means fast queries. Clustering Keys and Other Indexing Improvements *TokuDB* tables are clustered on the primary key. *TokuDB* also supports clustering secondary keys, providing better performance on a broader range of queries. A clustering key includes (or clusters) all of the columns in a table along with the key. As a result, one can efficiently retrieve any column when doing a range query on a clustering key. Also, with *TokuDB*, an auto-increment column can be used in any index and in any position within an index. Lastly, *TokuDB* indexes can include up to 32 columns. Less Aging/Fragmentation *TokuDB* can run much longer, likely indefinitely, without the need to perform the customary practice of dump/reload or `OPTIMIZE TABLE` to restore database performance. The key is the fundamental difference with which the Fractal Tree stores data on disk. Since, by default, the Fractal Tree will store data in 4MB chunks (pre-compression), as compared to InnoDB\u2019s 16KB, *TokuDB* has the ability to avoid \u201cdatabase disorder\u201d up to 250x better than InnoDB. Bulk Loader *TokuDB* uses a parallel loader to create tables and offline indexes. This parallel loader will use multiple cores for fast offline table and index creation. Full-Featured Database *TokuDB* supports fully ACID-compliant transactions, MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), serialized isolation levels, row-level locking, and XA. *TokuDB* scales with high number of client connections, even for large tables. Lock Diagnostics *TokuDB* provides users with the tools to diagnose locking and deadlock issues. For more information, see [Lock Visualization in TokuDB](tokudb_troubleshooting.md#lock-visualization-in-tokudb). Progress Tracking Running `SHOW PROCESSLIST` when adding indexes provides status on how many rows have been processed. Running `SHOW PROCESSLIST` also shows progress on queries, as well as insertions, deletions and updates. This information is helpful for estimating how long operations will take to complete. Fast Recovery *TokuDB* supports very fast recovery, typically less than a minute.","title":"TokuDB Introduction"},{"location":"tokudb/tokudb_intro.html#tokudb-introduction","text":"Important Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19 , the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported.

For more information, see the Percona blog post: Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . TokuDB is a highly scalable, zero-maintenance downtime MySQL storage engine that delivers indexing-based query acceleration, improved replication performance, unparalleled compression, and live schema modification. The TokuDB storage engine is a scalable, ACID and MVCC compliant storage engine that provides indexing-based query improvements, offers online schema modifications, and reduces replica lag for both hard disk drives and flash memory. This storage engine is specifically designed for high performance on write-intensive workloads which is achieved with Fractal Tree indexing. Percona Server for MySQL is compatible with the separately available TokuDB storage engine package. The TokuDB engine must be separately downloaded and then enabled as a plug-in component. This package can be installed alongside with standard Percona Server for MySQL releases and does not require any specially adapted version of Percona Server for MySQL . Warning Only the Percona supplied TokuDB engine should be used with Percona Server for MySQL . A TokuDB engine downloadedfrom other sources is not compatible. TokuDB file formats are not the same across MySQL variants. Migrating from one variant to any other variant requires a logical data dump and reload. Additional features unique to TokuDB include: Up to 25x Data Compression Fast Inserts Eliminates Replica Lag with Read Free Replication Hot Schema Changes Hot Index Creation - TokuDB tables support insertions, deletions and queries with no down time while indexes are being added to that table Hot column addition, deletion, expansion, and rename - TokuDB tables support insertions, deletions and queries without down-time when an alter table adds, deletes, expands, or renames columns On-line Backup Note The TokuDB storage engine does not support the nowait and skip locked modifiers introduced in the InnoDB storage engine with MySQL 8.0.

Compression lowers cost by reducing the amount of storage required and frees up disk space for additional indexes to achieve improved query performance.

Operating Systems TokuDB is currently supported on 64-bit Linux only. Memory TokuDB requires at least 1GB of main memory. For the best results, run with at least 2GB of main memory. Disk space and configuration Make sure to allocate enough disk space for data, indexes and logs. Due to high compression, TokuDB may achieve up to 25x space savings on dataand indexes over InnoDB . Creating Tables and Loading Data \u00b6 TokuDB tables are created the same way as other tables in MySQL by specifying ENGINE=TokuDB in the table definition. For example, the following command creates a table with a single column and uses the TokuDB storage engine to store its data: mysql > CREATE TABLE table ( id INT ( 11 ) NOT NULL ) ENGINE = TokuDB ; Loading data \u00b6 Once TokuDB tables have been created, data can be inserted or loaded using standard MySQL insert or bulk load operations. For example, the following command loads data from a file into the table: mysql > LOAD DATA INFILE file INTO TABLE table ; Note For more information about loading data, see the MySQL 8.0 reference manual. Migrating Data from an Existing Database \u00b6 Use the following command to convert an existing table for the TokuDB storage engine: mysql > ALTER TABLE table ENGINE = TokuDB ; Bulk Loading Data \u00b6 The TokuDB bulk loader imports data much faster than regular MySQL with InnoDB . To make use of the loader you need flat files in either comma separated or tab separated format. The MySQL LOAD DATA INFILE statement will invoke the bulk loader if the table is empty. Keep in mind that while this is the most convenient and, in most cases, the fastest way to initialize a TokuDB table, it may not be replication safe if applied to the source. To obtain the logical backup and then bulk load into TokuDB , follow these steps: Create a logical backup of the original table. The easiest way to achieve this is using SELECT \u2026 INTO OUTFILE . Keep in mind that the file will be created on the server: SELECT \\* FROM table INTO OUTFILE \u2018file.csv\u2019; Copy the output file either to the destination server or the client machine from which you plan to load it. Load the data into the server using LOAD DATA INFILE . If loading from a machine other than the server use the keyword LOCAL to point to the file on local machine. Keep in mind that you will need enough disk space on the temporary directory on the server since the local file will be copied onto the server by the MySQL client utility: LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INFILE \u2018file.csv\u2019; It is possible to create the CSV file using either mysqldump or the MySQL client utility as well, in which case the resulting file will reside on a local directory. In these 2 cases you have to make sure to use the correct command line options to create a file compatible with LOAD DATA INFILE . The bulk loader will use more space than normal for logs and temporary files while running, make sure that your file system has enough disk space to process your load. As a rule of thumb, it should be approximately 1.5 times the size of the raw data. Note Please read the original MySQL Documentation to understand the needed privileges and replication issues around LOAD DATA INFILE . Considerations to Run TokuDB in Production \u00b6 In most cases, the default options should be left in-place to run TokuDB , however it is a good idea to review some of the configuration parameters. Memory allocation \u00b6 TokuDB will allocate 50% of the installed RAM for its own cache (global variable tokudb_cache_size). While this is optimal in most situations, there are cases where it may lead to memory over allocation. If the system tries to allocate more memory than is available, the machine will begin swapping and run much slower than normal. It is necessary to set the tokudb_cache_size to a value other than the default in the following cases: Running other memory heavy processes on the same server as TokuDB In many cases, the database process needs to share the system with other server processes like additional database instances, http server, application server, e-mail server, monitoring systems and others. In order to properly configure TokuDB\u2019s memory consumption, it\u2019s important to understand how much free memory will be left and assign a sensible value for *TokuDB*. There is no fixed rule, but a conservative choice would be 50% of available RAM while all the other processes are running. If the result is under 2 GB, you should consider moving some of the other processes to a different system or using a dedicated database server. tokudb_cache_size is a static variable, so it needs to be set before starting the server and cannot be changed while the server is running. For example, to set up TokuDB\u2019s cache to 4G, add the following line to your `my.cnf` file: ``` tokudb_cache_size = 4G ``` System using InnoDB and TokuDB When using both the *TokuDB* and *InnoDB* storage engines, you need to manage the cache size for each. For example, on a server with 16 GB of RAM you could use the following values in your configuration file: ``` innodb_buffer_pool_size = 2G tokudb_cache_size = 8G ``` Using TokuDB with Federated or FederatedX tables The Federated engine in *MySQL* and FederatedX in *MariaDB* allow you to connect to a table on a remote server and query it as if it were a local table (please see the MySQL Documentation: 14.11. The FEDERATED Storage Engine for details). When accessing the remote table, these engines could import the complete table contents to the local server to execute a query. In this case, you will have to make sure that there is enough free memory on the server to handle these remote tables. For example, if your remote table is 8 GB in size, the server has to have more than 8 GB of free RAM to process queries against that table without going into swapping or causing a kernel panic and crash the *MySQL* process. There are no parameters to limit the amount of memory that the Federated or FederatedX engine will allocate while importing the remote dataset. Specifying the Location for Files \u00b6 As with InnoDB , it is possible to specify different locations than the default for TokuDB\u2019s data, log and temporary files. This way you may distribute the load and control the disk space. The following variables control file location: tokudb_data_dir: This variable defines the directory where the TokuDB tables are stored. The default location for TokuDB\u2019s data files is the MySQL data directory. tokudb_log_dir: This variable defines the directory where the TokuDB log files are stored. The default location for TokuDB\u2019s log files is the MySQL data directory. Configuring a separate log directory is somewhat involved and should be done only if absolutely necessary. We recommend to keep the data and log files under the same directory. tokudb_tmp_dir: This variable defines the directory where the TokuDB bulk loader stores temporary files. The bulk loader can create large temporary files while it is loading a table, so putting these temporary files on a disk separate from the data directory can be useful. For example, it can make sense to use a high-performance disk for the data directory and a very inexpensive disk for the temporary directory. The default location for TokuDB\u2019s temporary files is the MySQL data directory. Table Maintenance \u00b6 The fractal tree provides fast performance by inserting small messages in the buffers in the fractal trees instead of requiring a potential IO for an update on every row in the table as required by a B-tree. Additional background information on how fractal trees operate can be found here. For tables whose workload pattern is a high number of sequential deletes, it may be beneficial to flush these delete messages down to the basement nodes in order to allow for faster access. The way to perform this operation is via the OPTIMIZE command. The following extensions to the OPTIMIZE command have been added in TokuDB version 7.5.5: Hot Optimize Throttling \u00b6 By default, table optimization will run with all available resources. To limit the amount of resources, it is possible to limit the speed of table optimization. The tokudb_optimize_throttle session variable determines an upper bound on how many fractal tree leaf nodes per second are optimized. The default is 0 (no upper bound) with a valid range of [0,1000000]. For example, to limit the table optimization to 1 leaf node per second, use the following setting: SET tokudb_optimize_throttle=1; Optimize a Single Index of a Table \u00b6 To optimize a single index in a table, the tokudb_optimize_index_name session variable can be set to select the index by name. For example, to optimize the primary key of a table: mysql > SET tokudb_optimize_index_name = 'primary' ; OPTIMIZE TABLE t ; Optimize a Subset of a Fractal Tree Index \u00b6 For patterns where the left side of the tree has many deletions (a common pattern with increasing id or date values), it may be useful to delete a percentage of the tree. In this case, it is possible to optimize a subset of a fractal tree starting at the left side. The tokudb_optimize_index_fraction session variable controls the size of the sub tree. Valid values are in the range [0.0,1.0] with default 1.0 (optimize the whole tree). For example, to optimize the leftmost 10% of the primary key: SET tokudb_optimize_index_name='primary'; SET tokudb_optimize_index_fraction=0.1; OPTIMIZE TABLE t;","title":"Getting Started with TokuDB"},{"location":"tokudb/tokudb_quickstart.html#getting-started-with-tokudb","text":"Important Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19 , the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported.

We have removed the storage engine from the installation packages and disabled the storage engine in our binary builds. Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.26-16 , the binary builds and packages include but disable the TokuDB storage engine plugins. The tokudb_enabled option and the tokudb_backup_enabled option control the state of the plugins and have a default setting of FALSE. The result of attempting to load the plugins are the plugins fail to initialize and print a deprecation message. We recommend Migrating the data to the MyRocks storage engine . To enable the plugins to migrate to another storage engine, set the tokudb_enabled and tokudb_backup_enabled options to TRUE in your my.cnf file and restart your server instance. Then, you can load the plugins. The TokuDB storage engine was declared as deprecated in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . For more information, see the Percona blog post: Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . Known Issues \u00b6 Replication and binary logging : TokuDB supports binary logging and replication, with one restriction. TokuDB does not implement a lock on the auto-increment function, so concurrent insert statements with one or more of the statements inserting multiple rows may result in a non-deterministic interleaving of the auto-increment values. When running replication with these concurrent inserts, the auto-increment values on the replica table may not match the auto-increment values on the source table. Note that this is only an issue with Statement Based Replication (SBR), and not Row Based Replication (RBR). For more information about auto-increment and replication, see the MySQL Reference Manual: AUTO_INCREMENT handling in InnoDB . In addition, when using the REPLACE INTO or INSERT IGNORE on tables with no secondary indexes or tables where secondary indexes are subsets of the primary, the session variable tokudb_pk_insert_mode controls whether row based replication will work. Uninformative error message : The LOAD DATA INFILE command can sometimes produce `ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 1 from storage engine`. The message should say that the error is caused by insufficient disk space for the temporary files created by the loader. Transparent Huge Pages : TokuDB will refuse to start if transparent huge pages are enabled. Transparent huge page support can be disabled by issuing the following as root: # echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled Lock Note The previous command needs to be executed after every reboot, because it defaults to always . XA behavior vs. InnoDB : InnoDB forces a deadlocked XA transaction to abort, *TokuDB* does not. Disabling the unique checks : For tables with unique keys, every insertion into the table causes a lookup by key followed by an insertion, if the key is not in the table. This greatly limits insertion performance. If one knows by design that the rows being inserted into the table have unique keys, then one can disable the key lookup prior to insertion. If your primary key is an auto-increment key, and none of your secondary keys are declared to be unique, then setting unique_checks=OFF will provide limited performance gains. On the other hand, if your primary key has a lot of entropy (it looks random), or your secondary keys are declared unique and have a lot of entropy, then disabling unique checks can provide a significant performance boost. If unique_checks is disabled when the primary key is not unique, secondary indexes may become corrupted. In this case, the indexes should be dropped and rebuilt. This behavior differs from that of InnoDB , in which uniqueness is always checked on the primary key, and setting unique_checks to off turns off uniqueness checking on secondary indexes only. Turning off uniqueness checking on the primary key can provide large performance boosts, but it should only be done when the primary key is known to be unique. Group Replication : TokuDB storage engine doesn\u2019t support Group Replication . As of 8.0.17, InnoDB supports multi-valued indexes . TokuDB does not support this feature. As of 8.0.17, InnoDB supports the Clone Plugin and the Clone Plugin API. TokuDB tables do not support either of these features. Lock Visualization in TokuDB \u00b6 TokuDB uses key range locks to implement serializable transactions, which are acquired as the transaction progresses. The locks are released when the transaction commits or aborts (this implements two phase locking). TokuDB stores these locks in a data structure called the lock tree. The lock tree stores the set of range locks granted to each transaction. In addition, the lock tree stores the set of locks that are not granted due to a conflict with locks granted to some other transaction. When these other transactions are retired, these pending lock requests are retried. If a pending lock request is not granted before the lock timer expires, then the lock request is aborted. Lock visualization in TokuDB exposes the state of the lock tree with tables in the information schema. We also provide a mechanism that may be used by a database client to retrieve details about lock conflicts that it encountered while executing a transaction. The TOKUDB_TRX table \u00b6 The TOKUDB_TRX table in the INFORMATION_SCHEMA maps TokuDB transaction identifiers to MySQL client identifiers. This mapping allows one to associate a TokuDB transaction with a MySQL client operation. The following query returns the MySQL clients that have a live TokuDB transaction: SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_TRX , INFORMATION_SCHEMA . PROCESSLIST WHERE trx_mysql_thread_id = id ; The TOKUDB_LOCKS table \u00b6 The tokudb_locks table in the information schema contains the set of locks granted to TokuDB transactions. The following query returns all of the locks granted to some TokuDB transaction: SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCKS ; The following query returns the locks granted to some MySQL client: SELECT id FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCKS , INFORMATION_SCHEMA . PROCESSLIST WHERE locks_mysql_thread_id = id ; The TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS table \u00b6 The tokudb_lock_waits table in the information schema contains the set of lock requests that are not granted due to a lock conflict with some other transaction. The following query returns the locks that are waiting to be granted due to a lock conflict with some other transaction: SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS ; Supporting explicit DEFAULT value expressions as of 8.0.13-3 \u00b6 TokuDB does not support explicit DEFAULT value expressions as of verion 8.0.13-3. The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable \u00b6 The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable controls how lock timeouts and lock deadlocks seen by the database client are reported. The following values are available: 0 No lock timeouts or lock deadlocks are reported. 1 A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is stored in the tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable 2 A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is printed to the MySQL error log. Supported since 7.5.5 : In addition to the JSON document describing the lock conflict, the following lines are printed to the MySQL error log: A line containing the blocked thread id and blocked SQL A line containing the blocking thread id and the blocking SQL. 3 A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is stored in the tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable and is printed to the MySQL error log. Supported since 7.5.5 : In addition to the JSON document describing the lock conflict, the following lines are printed to the MySQL error log: A line containing the blocked thread id and blocked SQL A line containing the blocking thread id and the blocking SQL. The tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable \u00b6 The tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable contains a JSON document that describes the last lock conflict seen by the current MySQL client. It gets set when a blocked lock request times out or a lock deadlock is detected. The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable should have bit 0 set (decimal 1 ). Example \u00b6 Suppose that we create a table with a single column that is the primary key. mysql > SHOW CREATE TABLE table ; Create Table : CREATE TABLE \u2018 table \u2018 ( \u2018 id \u2018 int ( 11 ) NOT NULL , PRIMARY KEY ( \u2018 id \u2018 )) ENGINE = TokuDB DEFAULT CHARSET = latin1 Suppose that we have 2 MySQL clients with ID\u2019s 1 and 2 respectively. Suppose that MySQL client 1 inserts some values into table . TokuDB transaction 51 is created for the insert statement. Since autocommit is disabled, transaction 51 is still live after the insert statement completes, and we can query the tokudb_locks table in information schema to see the locks that are held by the transaction. mysql > SET AUTOCOMMIT = OFF ; mysql > INSERT INTO table VALUES ( 1 ),( 10 ),( 100 ); mysql > SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCKS ; mysql > SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS ; The keys are currently hex dumped. Now we switch to the other MySQL client with ID 2. mysql > INSERT INTO table VALUES ( 2 ),( 20 ),( 100 ); The insert gets blocked since there is a conflict on the primary key with value 100. The granted TokuDB locks are: SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCKS ; The locks that are pending due to a conflict are: SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCK_WAITS ; THe output could be: +-------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+ | requesting_trx_id | blocking_trx_id | lock_waits_dname | lock_waits_key_left | lock_waits_key_right | lock_waits_start_time | locks_table_schema | locks_table_name | locks_table_dictionary_name | +-------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+ | 62 | 51 | ./test/t-main | 0064000000 | 0064000000 | 1380656990910 | test | t | main | +-------------------+-----------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------+-----------------------+--------------------+------------------+-----------------------------+ Eventually, the lock for client 2 times out, and we can retrieve a JSON document that describes the conflict. SELECT @@ TOKUDB_LAST_LOCK_TIMEOUT ; ROLLBACK ; Since transaction 62 was rolled back, all of the locks taken by it are released. SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA . TOKUDB_LOCKS ; Engine Status \u00b6 Engine status provides details about the inner workings of TokuDB and can be useful in tuning your particular environment. The engine status can be determined by running the following command: SHOW ENGINE tokudb STATUS; The following is a reference of the table status statements: Table Status Description disk free space This is a gross estimate of how much of your file system is available. Possible displays in this field are: More than twice the reserve (\u201cmore than 10 percent of total file system space\u201d) Less than twice the reserve Less than the reserve File system is completely full time of environment creation This is the time when the TokuDB storage engine was first started up. Normally, this is when mysqld was initially installed with TokuDB . If the environment was upgraded from TokuDB 4.x (4.2.0 or later), then this will be displayed as \u201cDec 31, 1969\u201d on Linux hosts. time of engine startup This is the time when the TokuDB storage engine started up.

TokuDB does not implement a lock on the auto-increment function, so concurrent insert statements with one or more of the statements inserting multiple rows may result in a non-deterministic interleaving of the auto-increment values. When running replication with these concurrent inserts, the auto-increment values on the replica table may not match the auto-increment values on the source table. Note that this is only an issue with Statement Based Replication (SBR), and not Row Based Replication (RBR). For more information about auto-increment and replication, see the MySQL Reference Manual: AUTO_INCREMENT handling in InnoDB . In addition, when using the REPLACE INTO or INSERT IGNORE on tables with no secondary indexes or tables where secondary indexes are subsets of the primary, the session variable tokudb_pk_insert_mode controls whether row based replication will work. Uninformative error message : The LOAD DATA INFILE command can sometimes produce `ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 1 from storage engine`. The message should say that the error is caused by insufficient disk space for the temporary files created by the loader. Transparent Huge Pages : TokuDB will refuse to start if transparent huge pages are enabled. Transparent huge page support can be disabled by issuing the following as root: # echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/redhat_transparent_hugepage/enabled Lock Note The previous command needs to be executed after every reboot, because it defaults to always . XA behavior vs. InnoDB : InnoDB forces a deadlocked XA transaction to abort, *TokuDB* does not. Disabling the unique checks : For tables with unique keys, every insertion into the table causes a lookup by key followed by an insertion, if the key is not in the table. This greatly limits insertion performance. If one knows by design that the rows being inserted into the table have unique keys, then one can disable the key lookup prior to insertion. If your primary key is an auto-increment key, and none of your secondary keys are declared to be unique, then setting unique_checks=OFF will provide limited performance gains. On the other hand, if your primary key has a lot of entropy (it looks random), or your secondary keys are declared unique and have a lot of entropy, then disabling unique checks can provide a significant performance boost. If unique_checks is disabled when the primary key is not unique, secondary indexes may become corrupted. In this case, the indexes should be dropped and rebuilt. This behavior differs from that of InnoDB , in which uniqueness is always checked on the primary key, and setting unique_checks to off turns off uniqueness checking on secondary indexes only. Turning off uniqueness checking on the primary key can provide large performance boosts, but it should only be done when the primary key is known to be unique. Group Replication : TokuDB storage engine doesn\u2019t support Group Replication . As of 8.0.17, InnoDB supports multi-valued indexes . TokuDB does not support this feature. As of 8.0.17, InnoDB supports the Clone Plugin and the Clone Plugin API.

In addition, the lock tree stores the set of locks that are not granted due to a conflict with locks granted to some other transaction. When these other transactions are retired, these pending lock requests are retried. If a pending lock request is not granted before the lock timer expires, then the lock request is aborted.

We have removed the storage engine from the installation packages and disabled the storage engine in our binary builds. Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.26-16 , the binary builds and packages include but disable the TokuDB storage engine plugins. The tokudb_enabled option and the tokudb_backup_enabled option control the state of the plugins and have a default setting of FALSE. The result of attempting to load the plugins are the plugins fail to initialize and print a deprecation message. We recommend Migrating the data to the MyRocks storage engine . To enable the plugins to migrate to another storage engine, set the tokudb_enabled and tokudb_backup_enabled options to TRUE in your my.cnf file and restart your server instance. Then, you can load the plugins. The TokuDB storage engine was declared as deprecated in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . For more information, see the Percona blog post: Heads-Up: TokuDB Support Changes and Future Removal from Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 . Like all storage engines, TokuDB has variables to tune performance and control behavior. Fractal Tree algorithms are designed for near optimal performance and TokuDB\u2019s default settings should work well in most situations, eliminating the need for complex and time consuming tuning in most cases.

For example, to exclude all lost+found directories, use the following command: mysql > set tokudb_backup_exclude = '/lost\\\\+found($|/)' ; For more information see Percona TokuBackup . tokudb_backup_last_error \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 This session variable will contain the error number from the last backup. 0 indicates success. For more information see Percona TokuBackup. tokudb_backup_last_error_string \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type String Default NULL This session variable will contain the error string from the last backup. For more information see Percona TokuBackup. tokudb_backup_plugin_version \u00b6 Option Description Command-line No Config file No Scope Global Dynamic No Data type String This read-only server variable documents the version of the TokuBackup plugin. For more information see Percona TokuBackup. tokudb_backup_throttle \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 18446744073709551615 This variable specifies the maximum number of bytes per second the copier of a hot backup process will consume. Lowering its value will cause the hot backup operation to take more time but consume less I/O on the server. The default value is 18446744073709551615 which means no throttling. For more information see Percona TokuBackup. tokudb_backup_version \u00b6 Option Description Command-line No Config file No Scope Global Dynamic No Data type String This read-only server variable documents the version of the hot backup library. For more information see Percona TokuBackup. tokudb_block_size \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 512 MB Range 4096 - 4294967295 This variable controls the maximum size of node in memory before messages must be flushed or node must be split. Changing the value of tokudb_block_size only affects subsequently created tables and indexes. The value of this variable cannot be changed for an existing table/index without a dump and reload. tokudb_bulk_fetch \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON This variable determines if our bulk fetch algorithm is used for SELECT statements. SELECT statements include pure SELECT ... statements, as well as INSERT INTO table-name ... SELECT ... , CREATE TABLE table-name ... SELECT ... , REPLACE INTO table-name ... SELECT ... , INSERT IGNORE INTO table-name ... SELECT ... , and INSERT INTO table-name ... SELECT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE . tokudb_cache_size \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Numeric This variable configures the size in bytes of the TokuDB cache table. The default cache table size is \u00bd of physical memory. Percona highly recommends using the default setting if using buffered I/O, if using direct I/O then consider setting this parameter to 80% of available memory. Consider decreasing tokudb_cache_size if excessive swapping is causing performance problems. Swapping may occur when running multiple MySQL server instances or if other running applications use large amounts of physical memory. tokudb_cachetable_pool_threads \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0 - 1024 This variable defines the number of threads for the cachetable worker thread pool. This pool is used to perform node prefetches, and to serialize, compress, and write nodes during cachetable eviction. The default value of 0 calculates the pool size to be num_cpu_threads * 2. tokudb_check_jemalloc \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Boolean Default OFF This variable enables/disables startup checking if jemalloc is linked and correct version and that transparent huge pages are disabled. Used for testing only. tokudb_checkpoint_lock \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF Disables checkpointing when true. Session variable but acts like a global, any session disabling checkpointing disables it globally. If a session sets this lock and disconnects or terminates for any reason, the lock will not be released. Special purpose only, do not use this in your application. tokudb_checkpoint_on_flush_logs \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF When enabled forces a checkpoint if we get a flush logs command from the server. tokudb_checkpoint_pool_threads \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Dynamic No Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0 - 1024 This defines the number of threads for the checkpoint worker thread pool. This pool is used to serialize, compress and write nodes cloned during checkpoint. Default of 0 uses old algorithm to set pool size to num_cpu_threads/4 . tokudb_checkpointing_period \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 60 Range 0 - 4294967295 This variable specifies the time in seconds between the beginning of one checkpoint and the beginning of the next. The default time between TokuDB checkpoints is 60 seconds. We recommend leaving this variable unchanged. tokudb_cleaner_iterations \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 5 Range 0 - 18446744073709551615 This variable specifies how many internal nodes get processed in each tokudb_cleaner_period period. The default value is 5 . Setting this variable to 0 turns off cleaner threads. tokudb_cleaner_period \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 1 Range 0 - 18446744073709551615 This variable specifies how often in seconds the cleaner thread runs. The default value is 1 . Setting this variable to 0 turns off cleaner threads. tokudb_client_pool_threads \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0 - 1024 This variable defines the number of threads for the client operations thread pool. This pool is used to perform node maintenance on over/undersized nodes such as message flushing down the tree, node splits, and node merges. Default of 0 uses old algorithm to set pool size to 1 \\* num_cpu_threads . tokudb_commit_sync \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON Session variable tokudb_commit_sync controls whether or not the transaction log is flushed when a transaction commits. The default behavior is that the transaction log is flushed by the commit. Flushing the transaction log requires a disk write and may adversely affect the performance of your application. To disable synchronous flushing of the transaction log, disable the tokudb_commit_sync session variable as follows: SET tokudb_commit_sync = OFF ; Disabling this variable may make the system run faster. However, transactions committed since the last checkpoint are not guaranteed to survive a crash. Warning By disabling this variable and/or setting the tokudb_fsync_log_period to non-zero value you have effectively downgraded the durability of the storage engine. If you were to have a crash in this same window, you would lose data. The same issue would also appear if you were using some kind of volume snapshot for backups. tokudb_compress_buffers_before_eviction \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Boolean Default ON When this variable is enabled it allows the evictor to compress unused internal node partitions in order to reduce memory requirements as a first step of partial eviction before fully evicting the partition and eventually the entire node. tokudb_create_index_online \u00b6 This variable controls whether indexes created with the CREATE INDEX command are hot (if enabled), or offline (if disabled). Hot index creation means that the table is available for inserts and queries while the index is being created. Offline index creation means that the table is not available for inserts and queries while the index is being created. Note Hot index creation is slower than offline index creation. tokudb_data_dir \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type String Default NULL This variable configures the directory name where the TokuDB tables are stored. The default value is NULL which uses the location of the MySQL data directory. For more information check TokuDB files and file types and TokuDB file management. tokudb_debug \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0 - 18446744073709551615 This variable enables mysqld debug printing to STDERR for TokuDB . Produces tremendous amounts of output that is nearly useless to anyone but a TokuDB developer, not recommended for any production use at all. It is a mask value ULONG : #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_INIT (1<<0) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_OPEN (1<<1) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_ENTER (1<<2) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_RETURN (1<<3) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_ERROR (1<<4) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_TXN (1<<5) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_AUTO_INCREMENT (1<<6) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_INDEX_KEY (1<<7) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_LOCK (1<<8) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_CHECK_KEY (1<<9) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_HIDE_DDL_LOCK_ERRORS (1<<10) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_ALTER_TABLE (1<<11) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_UPSERT (1<<12) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_CHECK (1<<13) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_ANALYZE (1<<14) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_XA (1<<15) #define TOKUDB_DEBUG_SHARE (1<<16) tokudb_dir_per_db \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON When this variable is set to ON all new tables and indices will be placed within their corresponding database directory within the tokudb_data_dir or system datadir. Existing table files will not be automatically relocated to their corresponding database directory. If you rename a table, while this variable is enabled, the mapping in the Percona FT directory file will be updated and the files will be renamed on disk to reflect the new table name. For more information check TokuDB files and file types and TokuDB file management. tokudb_directio \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Boolean Default OFF When enabled, TokuDB employs Direct I/O rather than Buffered I/O for writes. When using Direct I/O, consider increasing tokudb_cache_size from its default of \u00bd physical memory. tokudb_disable_hot_alter \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF This variable is used specifically for testing or to disable hot alter in case there are bugs. Not for use in production. tokudb_disable_prefetching \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF TokuDB attempts to aggressively prefetch additional blocks of rows, which is helpful for most range queries but may create unnecessary I/O for range queries with LIMIT clauses. Prefetching is ON by default, with a value of 0 , it can be disabled by setting this variable to 1 . tokudb_disable_slow_alter \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF This variable is used specifically for testing or to disable hot alter in case there are bugs. Not for use in production. It controls whether slow alter tables are allowed. For example, the following command is slow because HCADER does not allow a mixture of column additions, deletions, or expansions: ALTER TABLE table ADD COLUMN column_a INT , DROP COLUMN column_b ; By default, tokudb_disable_slow_alter is disabled, and the engine reports back to MySQL that this is unsupported resulting in the following output: ERROR 1112 (42000): Table 'test_slow' uses an extension that doesn't exist in this MySQL version tokudb_empty_scan \u00b6 Defines direction to be used to perform table scan to check for empty tables for bulk loader. tokudb_enable_fast_update \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global/Session Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF Toggles the fast updates feature ON/OFF for the UPDATE statement. Fast update involves queries optimization to avoid random reads during their execution. tokudb_enable_fast_upsert \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global/Session Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF Toggles the fast updates feature ON/OFF for the INSERT statement. Fast update involves queries optimization to avoid random reads during their execution. tokudb_enable_partial_eviction \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Boolean Default OFF This variable is used to control if partial eviction of nodes is enabled or disabled. tokudb_fanout \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 16 Range 2-16384 This variable controls the Fractal Tree fanout. The fanout defines the number of pivot keys or child nodes for each internal tree node. Changing the value of tokudb_fanout only affects subsequently created tables and indexes. The value of this variable cannot be changed for an existing table/index without a dump and reload. tokudb_fs_reserve_percent \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Numeric Default 5 Range 0-100 This variable controls the percentage of the file system that must be available for inserts to be allowed. By default, this is set to 5 . We recommend that this reserve be at least half the size of your physical memory. See Full Disks for more information. tokudb_fsync_log_period \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0-4294967295 This variable controls the frequency, in milliseconds, for fsync() operations. If set to 0 then the fsync() behavior is only controlled by the tokudb_commit_sync, which can be ON or OFF . tokudb_hide_default_row_format \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON This variable is used to hide the ROW_FORMAT in SHOW CREATE TABLE . If zlib compression is used, row format will show as DEFAULT . tokudb_killed_time \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 4000 Range 0-18446744073709551615 This variable is used to specify frequency in milliseconds for lock wait to check to see if the lock was killed. tokudb_last_lock_timeout \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type String Default NULL This variable contains a JSON document that describes the last lock conflict seen by the current MySQL client. It gets set when a blocked lock request times out or a lock deadlock is detected. The tokudb_lock_timeout_debug session variable must have bit 0 set for this behavior, otherwise this session variable will be empty. tokudb_load_save_space \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON This session variable changes the behavior of the bulk loader. When it is disabled the bulk loader stores intermediate data using uncompressed files (which consumes additional CPU), whereas ON compresses the intermediate files. Note The location of the temporary disk space used by the bulk loader may be specified with the tokudb_tmp_dir server variable. If a LOAD DATA INFILE statement fails with the error message ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 1 from storage engine, then there may not be enough disk space for the optimized loader, so disable tokudb_prelock_empty and try again. More information is available in Known Issues. tokudb_loader_memory_size \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 100000000 Range 0-18446744073709551615 This variable limits the amount of memory (in bytes) that the TokuDB bulk loader will use for each loader instance. Increasing this value may provide a performance benefit when loading extremely large tables with several secondary indexes. Note Memory allocated to a loader is taken from the TokuDB cache, defined in tokudb_cache_size, and may impact the running workload\u2019s performance as existing cached data must be ejected for the loader to begin. tokudb_lock_timeout \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 4000 Range 0-18446744073709551615 This variable controls the amount of time that a transaction will wait for a lock held by another transaction to be released. If the conflicting transaction does not release the lock within the lock timeout, the transaction that was waiting for the lock will get a lock timeout error. The units are milliseconds. A value of 0 disables lock waits. The default value is 4000 (four seconds). If your application gets a lock wait timeout error (-30994), then you may find that increasing the tokudb_lock_timeout may help. If your application gets a deadlock found error (-30995), then you need to abort the current transaction and retry it. tokudb_lock_timeout_debug \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 1 Range 0-3 The following values are available: 0 : No lock timeouts or lock deadlocks are reported. 1 : A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is stored in the tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable 2 : A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is printed to the MySQL error log. In addition to the JSON document describing the lock conflict, the following lines are printed to the MySQL error log: * A line containing the blocked thread id and blocked SQL * A line containing the blocking thread id and the blocking SQL. 3 : A JSON document that describes the lock conflict is stored in the tokudb_last_lock_timeout session variable and is printed to the MySQL error log. In addition to the JSON document describing the lock conflict, the following lines are printed to the MySQL error log: * A line containing the blocked thread id and blocked SQL * A line containing the blocking thread id and the blocking SQL. tokudb_log_dir \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type String Default NULL This variable specifies the directory where the TokuDB log files are stored. The default value is NULL which uses the location of the MySQL data directory. Configuring a separate log directory is somewhat involved. Please contact Percona support for more details. For more information check TokuDB files and file types and TokuDB file management. Warning After changing TokuDB log directory path, the old TokuDB recovery log file should be moved to new directory prior to start of MySQL server and log file\u2019s owner must be the mysql user. Otherwise server will fail to initialize the TokuDB store engine restart. tokudb_max_lock_memory \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type Numeric Default 65560320 Range 0-18446744073709551615 This variable specifies the maximum amount of memory for the PerconaFT lock table. tokudb_optimize_index_fraction \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 1.000000 Range 0.000000 - 1.000000 For patterns where the left side of the tree has many deletions (a common pattern with increasing id or date values), it may be useful to delete a percentage of the tree. In this case, it\u2019s possible to optimize a subset of a fractal tree starting at the left side. The tokudb_optimize_index_fraction session variable controls the size of the sub tree. Valid values are in the range [0.0,1.0] with default 1.0 (optimize the whole tree). tokudb_optimize_index_name \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type String Default NULL This variable can be used to optimize a single index in a table, it can be set to select the index by name. tokudb_optimize_throttle \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0-18446744073709551615 By default, table optimization will run with all available resources. To limit the amount of resources, it is possible to limit the speed of table optimization. This determines an upper bound on how many fractal tree leaf nodes per second are optimized. The default 0 imposes no limit. tokudb_pk_insert_mode \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 1 Range 0-3 Note The tokudb_pk_insert_mode session variable was removed and the behavior is now that of the former tokudb_pk_insert_mode set to 1 . The optimization will be used where safe and not used where not safe. tokudb_prelock_empty \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON By default TokuDB preemptively grabs an entire table lock on empty tables. If one transaction is doing the loading, such as when the user is doing a table load into an empty table, this default provides a considerable speedup. However, if multiple transactions try to do concurrent operations on an empty table, all but one transaction will be locked out. Disabling tokudb_prelock_empty optimizes for this multi-transaction case by turning off preemptive pre-locking. Note If this variable is set to OFF , fast bulk loading is turned off as well. tokudb_read_block_size \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 16384 (16KB) Range 4096 - 4294967295 Fractal tree leaves are subdivided into read blocks, in order to speed up point queries. This variable controls the target uncompressed size of the read blocks. The units are bytes and the default is 64 KB. A smaller value favors read performance for point and small range scans over large range scans and higher compression. The minimum value of this variable is 4096 (4KB). Changing the value of tokudb_read_block_size only affects subsequently created tables. The value of this variable cannot be changed for an existing table without a dump and reload. tokudb_read_buf_size \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 131072 (128KB) Range 0 - 1048576 This variable controls the size of the buffer used to store values that are bulk fetched as part of a large range query. Its unit is bytes and its default value is 131,072 (128 KB). A value of 0 turns off bulk fetching. Each client keeps a thread of this size, so it should be lowered if situations where there are a large number of clients simultaneously querying a table. tokudb_read_status_frequency \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 10000 Range 0 - 4294967295 This variable controls in how many reads the progress is measured to display SHOW PROCESSLIST . Reads are defined as SELECT queries. For slow queries, it can be helpful to set this variable and tokudb_write_status_frequency to 1 , and then run SHOW PROCESSLIST several times to understand what progress is being made. tokudb_row_format \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type ENUM Default TOKUDB_QUICKLZ Range TOKUDB_DEFAULT, TOKUDB_FAST, TOKUDB_SMALL, TOKUDB_ZLIB, TOKUDB_QUICKLZ, TOKUDB_LZMA, TOKUDB_SNAPPY, TOKUDB_UNCOMPRESSED This controls the default compression algorithm used to compress data. For more information on compression algorithms see Compression Details. tokudb_rpl_check_readonly \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON The TokuDB replication code will run row events from the binary log with Read Free Replication when the replica is in read-only mode. This variable is used to disable the replica read only check in the TokuDB replication code. This allows Read-Free-Replication to run when the replica is NOT read-only. By default, tokudb_rpl_check_readonly is enabled (check that replica is read-only). Do NOT change this value unless you completely understand the implications! tokudb_rpl_lookup_rows \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON When disabled, TokuDB replication replicas skip row lookups for delete row log events and update row log events, which eliminates all associated read I/O for these operations. Warning TokuDB Read Free Replication will not propagate UPDATE and DELETE events reliably if TokuDB table is missing the primary key which will eventually lead to data inconsistency on the replica. Note Optimization is only enabled when read_only is set to 1 and binlog_format is ROW . tokudb_rpl_lookup_rows_delay \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0 - 18446744073709551615 This variable allows for simulation of long disk reads by sleeping for the given number of microseconds prior to the row lookup query, it should only be set to a non-zero value for testing. tokudb_rpl_unique_checks \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON When disabled, TokuDB replication replicas skip uniqueness checks on inserts and updates, which eliminates all associated read I/O for these operations. Note Optimization is only enabled when read_only is set to 1 and binlog_format is ROW . tokudb_rpl_unique_checks_delay \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 0 Range 0 - 18446744073709551615 This variable allows for simulation of long disk reads by sleeping for the given number of microseconds prior to the row lookup query, it should only be set to a non-zero value for testing. tokudb_strip_frm_data \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default OFF When this variable is set to ON during the startup server will check all the status files and remove the embedded .frm metadata. This variable can be used to assist in TokuDB data recovery. Warning Use this variable only if you know what you\u2019re doing otherwise it could lead to data loss. tokudb_support_xa \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Session, Global Dynamic Yes Data type Boolean Default ON This variable defines whether or not the prepare phase of an XA transaction performs an fsync() . tokudb_tmp_dir \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic No Data type String This variable specifies the directory where the TokuDB bulk loader stores temporary files. The bulk loader can create large temporary files while it is loading a table, so putting these temporary files on a disk separate from the data directory can be useful. For example, it can make sense to use a high-performance disk for the data directory and a very inexpensive disk for the temporary directory. The default location for TokuDB\u2019s temporary files is the MySQL data directory. tokudb_load_save_space determines whether the data is compressed or not. The error message ERROR 1030 (HY000): Got error 1 from storage engine could indicate that the disk has run out of space. For more information check TokuDB files and file types and TokuDB file management. tokudb_version \u00b6 Option Description Command-line No Config file No Scope Global Dynamic No Data type String This read-only variable documents the version of the TokuDB storage engine. tokudb_write_status_frequency \u00b6 Option Description Command-line Yes Config file Yes Scope Global Dynamic Yes Data type Numeric Default 1000 Range 0 - 4294967295 This variable controls in how many writes the progress is measured to display SHOW PROCESSLIST . Writes are defined as INSERT , UPDATE and DELETE queries. For slow queries, it can be helpful to set this variable and tokudb_read_status_frequency to 1, and then run SHOW PROCESSLIST several times to understand what progress is being made.","title":"TokuDB Variables"},{"location":"tokudb/tokudb_variables.html#tokudb-variables","text":"Important Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19 , the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported.

Fast Insertions and Richer Indexes \u00b6 TokuDB\u2019s fast indexing enables fast queries through the use of rich indexes, such as covering and clustering indexes. It\u2019s worth investing some time to optimize index definitions to get the best performance from MySQL and TokuDB . Here are some resources to get you started: \u201cUnderstanding Indexing\u201d by Zardosht Kasheff ( video ) Rule of Thumb for Choosing Column Order in Indexes Covering Indexes: Orders-of-Magnitude Improvements Introducing Multiple Clustering Indexes Clustering Indexes vs. Covering Indexes How Clustering Indexes Sometimes Helps UPDATE and DELETE Performance High Performance MySQL, 3 rd Edition by Baron Schwartz, Peter Zaitsev, Vadim Tkachenko, Copyright 2012, O\u2019Reilly Media. See Chapter 5, Indexing for High Performance . Clustering Secondary Indexes \u00b6 One of the keys to exploiting TokuDB\u2019s strength in indexing is to make use of clustering secondary indexes. TokuDB allows a secondary key to be defined as a clustering key. This means that all of the columns in the table are clustered with the secondary key. Percona Server for MySQL parser and query optimizer support Multiple Clustering Keys when TokuDB engine is used. This means that the query optimizer will avoid primary clustered index reads and replace them by secondary clustered index reads in certain scenarios. The parser has been extended to support following syntax: CREATE TABLE ... ( ..., CLUSTERING KEY identifier ( column list ), ... CREATE TABLE ... ( ..., UNIQUE CLUSTERING KEY identifier ( column list ), ... CREATE TABLE ... ( ..., CLUSTERING UNIQUE KEY identifier ( column list ), ... CREATE TABLE ... ( ..., CONSTRAINT identifier UNIQUE CLUSTERING KEY identifier ( column list ), ... CREATE TABLE ... ( ..., CONSTRAINT identifier CLUSTERING UNIQUE KEY identifier ( column list ), ... CREATE TABLE ...

ALTER TABLE ..., ADD UNIQUE CLUSTERING INDEX identifier ( column list ), ... ALTER TABLE ..., ADD CLUSTERING UNIQUE INDEX identifier ( column list ), ... ALTER TABLE ..., ADD CONSTRAINT identifier UNIQUE CLUSTERING INDEX identifier ( column list ), ... ALTER TABLE ..., ADD CONSTRAINT identifier CLUSTERING UNIQUE INDEX identifier ( column list ), ... CREATE CLUSTERING INDEX identifier ON ... To define a secondary index as clustering, simply add the word CLUSTERING before the key definition. For example: CREATE TABLE foo ( column_a INT , column_b INT , column_c INT , PRIMARY KEY index_a ( column_a ), CLUSTERING KEY index_b ( column_b )) ENGINE = TokuDB ; In the previous example, the primary table is indexed on column_a . Additionally, there is a secondary clustering index (named index_b ) sorted on column_b . Unlike non-clustered indexes, clustering indexes include all the columns of a table and can be used as covering indexes. For example, the following query will run very fast using the clustering index_b : SELECT column_c FROM foo WHERE column_b BETWEEN 10 AND 100 ; This index is sorted on column_b , making the WHERE clause fast, and includes column_c , which avoids lookups in the primary table to satisfy the query. TokuDB makes clustering indexes feasible because of its excellent compression and very high indexing rates. For more information about using clustering indexes, see Introducing Multiple Clustering Indexes . Hot Index Creation \u00b6 TokuDB enables you to add indexes to an existing table and still perform inserts and queries on that table while the index is being created. The ONLINE keyword is not used. Instead, the value of the tokudb_create_index_online client session variable is examined. Hot index creation is invoked using the CREATE INDEX command after setting tokudb_create_index_online to on as follows: mysql > SET tokudb_create_index_online = on ; Query OK , 0 rows affected ( 0 . 00 sec ) mysql > CREATE INDEX index ON foo ( field_name ); Alternatively, using the ALTER TABLE command for creating an index will create the index offline (with the table unavailable for inserts or queries), regardless of the value of tokudb_create_index_online. The only way to hot create an index is to use the CREATE INDEX command. Hot creating an index will be slower than creating the index offline, and progress depends how busy the mysqld server is with other tasks. Progress of the index creation can be seen by using the SHOW PROCESSLIST command (in another client). Once the index creation completes, the new index will be used in future query plans. If more than one hot CREATE INDEX is issued for a particular table, the indexes will be created serially. An index creation that is waiting for another to complete will be shown as Locked in SHOW PROCESSLIST . We recommend that each CREATE INDEX be allowed to complete before the next one is started. Hot Column Add, Delete, Expand, and Rename (HCADER) \u00b6 TokuDB enables you to add or delete columns in an existing table, expand char , varchar , varbinary , and integer type columns in an existing table, or rename an existing column in a table with little blocking of other updates and queries. HCADER typically blocks other queries with a table lock for no more than a few seconds. After that initial short-term table locking, the system modifies each row (when adding, deleting, or expanding columns) later, when the row is next brought into main memory from disk. For column rename, all the work is done during the seconds of downtime. On-disk rows need not be modified. To get good performance from HCADER, observe the following guidelines: The work of altering the table for column addition, deletion, or expansion is performed as subsequent operations touch parts of the Fractal Tree, both in the primary index and secondary indexes. You can force the column addition, deletion, or expansion work to be performed all at once using the standard syntax of OPTIMIZE TABLE X , when a column has been added to, deleted from, or expanded in table X. It is important to note that as of TokuDB version 7.1.0, OPTIMIZE TABLE is also hot, so that a table supports updates and queries without blocking while an OPTIMIZE TABLE is being performed. Also, a hot OPTIMIZE TABLE does not rebuild the indexes, since TokuDB indexes do not age. Rather, they flush all background work, such as that induced by a hot column addition, deletion, or expansion. Each hot column addition, deletion, or expansion operation must be performed individually (with its own SQL statement). If you want to add, delete, or expand multiple columns use multiple statements. Avoid adding, deleting, or expanding a column at the same time as adding or dropping an index. The time that the table lock is held can vary. The table-locking time for HCADER is dominated by the time it takes to flush dirty pages, because MySQL closes the table after altering it. If a checkpoint has happened recently, this operation is fast (on the order of seconds). However, if the table has many dirty pages, then the flushing stage can take on the order of minutes. Avoid dropping a column that is part of an index. If a column to be dropped is part of an index, then dropping that column is slow. To drop a column that is part of an index, first drop the indexes that reference the column in one alter table statement, and then drop the column in another statement. Hot column expansion operations are only supported to char , varchar , varbinary , and integer data types. Hot column expansion is not supported if the given column is part of the primary key or any secondary keys. Rename only one column per statement. Renaming more than one column will revert to the standard MySQL blocking behavior. The proper syntax is as follows: ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column_old column_new DATA_TYPE REQUIRED_NESS DEFAULT Here\u2019s an example of how that might look: ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column_old column_new INT ( 10 ) NOT NULL ; Notice that all of the column attributes must be specified. ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column_old column_new; induces a slow, blocking column rename. Hot column rename does not support the following data types: TIME , ENUM , BLOB , TINYBLOB , MEDIUMBLOB , LONGBLOB . Renaming columns of these types will revert to the standard MySQL blocking behavior. Temporary tables cannot take advantage of HCADER. Temporary tables are typically small anyway, so altering them using the standard method is usually fast. Compression Details \u00b6 TokuDB offers different levels of compression, which trade off between the amount of CPU used and the compression achieved. Standard compression uses less CPU but generally compresses at a lower level, high compression uses more CPU and generally compresses at a higher level. We have seen compression up to 25x on customer data. Compression in TokuDB occurs on background threads, which means that high compression need not slow down your database. Indeed, in some settings, we\u2019ve seen higher overall database performance with high compression. Note We recommend that users use standard compression on machines with six or fewer cores, and high compression on machines with more than six cores. The ultimate choice depends on the particulars of how a database is used, and we recommend that users use the default settings unless they have profiled their system with high compression in place. The table is compressed using whichever row format is specified in the session variable tokudb_row_format. If no row format is set nor is tokudb_row_format, the QUICKLZ compression algorithm is used. The row_format and tokudb_row_format variables accept the following values: Value Description TOKUDB_DEFAULT Sets the compression to the default behavior. As of TokuDB 7.1.0, the default behavior is to compress using the zlib library. In the future this behavior may change. TOKUDB_FAST Sets the compression to use the quicklz library. TOKUDB_SMALL Sets the compression to use the lzma library. TOKUDB_ZLIB Compress using the zlib library, which provides mid-range compression and CPU utilization. TOKUDB_QUICKLZ Compress using the quicklz library, which provides light compression and low CPU utilization. TOKUDB_LZMA Compress using the lzma library, which provides the highest compression and high CPU utilization. TOKUDB_SNAPPY This compression is using snappy library and aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. TOKUDB_UNCOMPRESSED This setting turns off compression and is useful for tables with data that cannot be compressed. Read Free Replication \u00b6 TokuDB replicas can be configured to perform significantly less read IO in order to apply changes from the source. By utilizing the power of Fractal Tree indexes: insert/update/delete operations can be configured to eliminate read-modify-write behavior and simply inject messages into the appropriate Fractal Tree indexes update/delete operations can be configured to eliminate the IO required for uniqueness checking To enable Read Free Replication, the servers must be configured as follows: On the replication source: Enable row based replication: set BINLOG_FORMAT=ROW On the replication replica(s): The replica must be in read-only mode: set read_only=1 Disable unique checks: set tokudb_rpl_unique_checks=0 Disable lookups (read-modify-write): set tokudb_rpl_lookup_rows=0 Note You can modify one or both behaviors on the replica(s). Note As long as the source is using row based replication, this optimization is available on a TokuDB replica. This means that it\u2019s available even if the source is using InnoDB or MyISAM tables, or running non-TokuDB binaries. Warning TokuDB Read Free Replication will not propagate UPDATE and DELETE events reliably if TokuDB table is missing the primary key which will eventually lead to data inconsistency on the replica. Transactions and ACID-compliant Recovery \u00b6 By default, TokuDB checkpoints all open tables regularly and logs all changes between checkpoints, so that after a power failure or system crash, TokuDB will restore all tables into their fully ACID-compliant state. That is, all committed transactions will be reflected in the tables, and any transaction not committed at the time of failure will be rolled back. The default checkpoint period is every 60 seconds, and this specifies the time from the beginning of one checkpoint to the beginning of the next. If a checkpoint requires more than the defined checkpoint period to complete, the next checkpoint begins immediately. It is also related to the frequency with which log files are trimmed, as described below. The user can induce a checkpoint at any time by issuing the FLUSH LOGS command. When a database is shut down normally it is also checkpointed and all open transactions are aborted. The logs are trimmed at startup. Managing Log Size \u00b6 TokuDB keeps log files back to the most recent checkpoint. Whenever a log file reaches 100 MB, a new log file is started. Whenever there is a checkpoint, all log files older than the checkpoint are discarded. If the checkpoint period is set to be a very large number, logs will get trimmed less frequently. This value is set to 60 seconds by default. TokuDB also keeps rollback logs for each open transaction. The size of each log is proportional to the amount of work done by its transaction and is stored compressed on disk. Rollback logs are trimmed when the associated transaction completes. Recovery \u00b6 Recovery is fully automatic with TokuDB . TokuDB uses both the log files and rollback logs to recover from a crash. The time to recover from a crash is proportional to the combined size of the log files and uncompressed size of rollback logs. Thus, if there were no long-standing transactions open at the time of the most recent checkpoint, recovery will take less than a minute. Disabling the Write Cache \u00b6 When using any transaction-safe database, it is essential that you understand the write-caching characteristics of your hardware. TokuDB provides transaction safe (ACID compliant) data storage for MySQL . However, if the underlying operating system or hardware does not actually write data to disk when it says it did, the system can corrupt your database when the machine crashes. For example, TokuDB can not guarantee proper recovery if it is mounted on an NFS volume. It is always safe to disable the write cache, but you may be giving up some performance. For most configurations you must disable the write cache on your disk drives. On ATA/SATA drives, the following command should disable the write cache: $ hdparm -W0 /dev/hda There are some cases when you can keep the write cache, for example: Write caching can remain enabled when using XFS, but only if XFS reports that disk write barriers work. If you see one of the following messages in /var/log/messages, then you must disable the write cache: Disabling barriers, not supported with external log device Disabling barriers, not supported by the underlying device Disabling barriers, trial barrier write failed XFS write barriers appear to succeed for single disks (with no LVM), or for certain kernels such as that provided by Fedora 12. In the following cases, you must disable the write cache: If you use the ext3 filesystem If you use LVM (although recent Linux kernels, such as Fedora 12, have fixed this problem) If you use Linux\u2019s software RAID If you use a RAID controller with battery-backed-up memory. This may seem counter-intuitive. For more information, see the XFS FAQ In summary, you should disable the write cache, unless you have a very specific reason not to do so. Progress Tracking \u00b6 TokuDB has a system for tracking progress of long running statements, thereby removing the need to define triggers to track statement execution, as follows: Bulk Load: When loading large tables using LOAD DATA INFILE commands, doing a SHOW PROCESSLIST command in a separate client session shows progress. There are two progress stages. The first will state something like Inserted about 1000000 rows . After all rows are processed like this, the next stage tracks progress by showing what fraction of the work is done (e.g. Loading of data about 45% done ) Adding Indexes: When adding indexes via ALTER TABLE or CREATE INDEX , the command SHOW PROCESSLIST shows progress. When adding indexes via ALTER TABLE or CREATE INDEX , the command SHOW PROCESSLIST will include an estimation of the number of rows processed. Use this information to verify progress is being made. Similar to bulk loading, the first stage shows how many rows have been processed, and the second stage shows progress with a fraction. Commits and Aborts: When committing or aborting a transaction, the command SHOW PROCESSLIST will include an estimate of the transactional operations processed. Migrating to TokuDB \u00b6 To convert an existing table to use the TokuDB engine, run ALTER TABLE... ENGINE=TokuDB . If you wish to load from a file, use LOAD DATA INFILE and not mysqldump . Using mysqldump will be much slower. To create a file that can be loaded with LOAD DATA INFILE , refer to the INTO OUTFILE option of the SELECT Syntax . Note Creating this file does not save the schema of your table, so you may want to create a copy of that as well.","title":"Using TokuDB"},{"location":"tokudb/using_tokudb.html#using-tokudb","text":"Important Starting with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.28-19 , the TokuDB storage engine is no longer supported.

Progress of the index creation can be seen by using the SHOW PROCESSLIST command (in another client). Once the index creation completes, the new index will be used in future query plans. If more than one hot CREATE INDEX is issued for a particular table, the indexes will be created serially. An index creation that is waiting for another to complete will be shown as Locked in SHOW PROCESSLIST . We recommend that each CREATE INDEX be allowed to complete before the next one is started.","title":"Hot Index Creation"},{"location":"tokudb/using_tokudb.html#hot-column-add-delete-expand-and-rename-hcader","text":"TokuDB enables you to add or delete columns in an existing table, expand char , varchar , varbinary , and integer type columns in an existing table, or rename an existing column in a table with little blocking of other updates and queries. HCADER typically blocks other queries with a table lock for no more than a few seconds. After that initial short-term table locking, the system modifies each row (when adding, deleting, or expanding columns) later, when the row is next brought into main memory from disk. For column rename, all the work is done during the seconds of downtime. On-disk rows need not be modified. To get good performance from HCADER, observe the following guidelines: The work of altering the table for column addition, deletion, or expansion is performed as subsequent operations touch parts of the Fractal Tree, both in the primary index and secondary indexes. You can force the column addition, deletion, or expansion work to be performed all at once using the standard syntax of OPTIMIZE TABLE X , when a column has been added to, deleted from, or expanded in table X. It is important to note that as of TokuDB version 7.1.0, OPTIMIZE TABLE is also hot, so that a table supports updates and queries without blocking while an OPTIMIZE TABLE is being performed. Also, a hot OPTIMIZE TABLE does not rebuild the indexes, since TokuDB indexes do not age. Rather, they flush all background work, such as that induced by a hot column addition, deletion, or expansion. Each hot column addition, deletion, or expansion operation must be performed individually (with its own SQL statement). If you want to add, delete, or expand multiple columns use multiple statements. Avoid adding, deleting, or expanding a column at the same time as adding or dropping an index. The time that the table lock is held can vary. The table-locking time for HCADER is dominated by the time it takes to flush dirty pages, because MySQL closes the table after altering it. If a checkpoint has happened recently, this operation is fast (on the order of seconds). However, if the table has many dirty pages, then the flushing stage can take on the order of minutes. Avoid dropping a column that is part of an index. If a column to be dropped is part of an index, then dropping that column is slow. To drop a column that is part of an index, first drop the indexes that reference the column in one alter table statement, and then drop the column in another statement. Hot column expansion operations are only supported to char , varchar , varbinary , and integer data types. Hot column expansion is not supported if the given column is part of the primary key or any secondary keys. Rename only one column per statement. Renaming more than one column will revert to the standard MySQL blocking behavior. The proper syntax is as follows: ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column_old column_new DATA_TYPE REQUIRED_NESS DEFAULT Here\u2019s an example of how that might look: ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column_old column_new INT ( 10 ) NOT NULL ; Notice that all of the column attributes must be specified. ALTER TABLE table CHANGE column_old column_new; induces a slow, blocking column rename. Hot column rename does not support the following data types: TIME , ENUM , BLOB , TINYBLOB , MEDIUMBLOB , LONGBLOB . Renaming columns of these types will revert to the standard MySQL blocking behavior. Temporary tables cannot take advantage of HCADER. Temporary tables are typically small anyway, so altering them using the standard method is usually fast.","title":"Hot Column Add, Delete, Expand, and Rename (HCADER)"},{"location":"tokudb/using_tokudb.html#compression-details","text":"TokuDB offers different levels of compression, which trade off between the amount of CPU used and the compression achieved. Standard compression uses less CPU but generally compresses at a lower level, high compression uses more CPU and generally compresses at a higher level. We have seen compression up to 25x on customer data. Compression in TokuDB occurs on background threads, which means that high compression need not slow down your database. Indeed, in some settings, we\u2019ve seen higher overall database performance with high compression. Note We recommend that users use standard compression on machines with six or fewer cores, and high compression on machines with more than six cores. The ultimate choice depends on the particulars of how a database is used, and we recommend that users use the default settings unless they have profiled their system with high compression in place. The table is compressed using whichever row format is specified in the session variable tokudb_row_format. If no row format is set nor is tokudb_row_format, the QUICKLZ compression algorithm is used. The row_format and tokudb_row_format variables accept the following values: Value Description TOKUDB_DEFAULT Sets the compression to the default behavior. As of TokuDB 7.1.0, the default behavior is to compress using the zlib library. In the future this behavior may change. TOKUDB_FAST Sets the compression to use the quicklz library. TOKUDB_SMALL Sets the compression to use the lzma library. TOKUDB_ZLIB Compress using the zlib library, which provides mid-range compression and CPU utilization. TOKUDB_QUICKLZ Compress using the quicklz library, which provides light compression and low CPU utilization. TOKUDB_LZMA Compress using the lzma library, which provides the highest compression and high CPU utilization. TOKUDB_SNAPPY This compression is using snappy library and aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression. TOKUDB_UNCOMPRESSED This setting turns off compression and is useful for tables with data that cannot be compressed.","title":"Compression Details"},{"location":"tokudb/using_tokudb.html#read-free-replication","text":"TokuDB replicas can be configured to perform significantly less read IO in order to apply changes from the source.

That is, all committed transactions will be reflected in the tables, and any transaction not committed at the time of failure will be rolled back. The default checkpoint period is every 60 seconds, and this specifies the time from the beginning of one checkpoint to the beginning of the next. If a checkpoint requires more than the defined checkpoint period to complete, the next checkpoint begins immediately. It is also related to the frequency with which log files are trimmed, as described below. The user can induce a checkpoint at any time by issuing the FLUSH LOGS command. When a database is shut down normally it is also checkpointed and all open transactions are aborted.

TokuDB provides transaction safe (ACID compliant) data storage for MySQL . However, if the underlying operating system or hardware does not actually write data to disk when it says it did, the system can corrupt your database when the machine crashes. For example, TokuDB can not guarantee proper recovery if it is mounted on an NFS volume. It is always safe to disable the write cache, but you may be giving up some performance. For most configurations you must disable the write cache on your disk drives. On ATA/SATA drives, the following command should disable the write cache: $ hdparm -W0 /dev/hda There are some cases when you can keep the write cache, for example: Write caching can remain enabled when using XFS, but only if XFS reports that disk write barriers work. If you see one of the following messages in /var/log/messages, then you must disable the write cache: Disabling barriers, not supported with external log device Disabling barriers, not supported by the underlying device Disabling barriers, trial barrier write failed XFS write barriers appear to succeed for single disks (with no LVM), or for certain kernels such as that provided by Fedora 12. In the following cases, you must disable the write cache: If you use the ext3 filesystem If you use LVM (although recent Linux kernels, such as Fedora 12, have fixed this problem) If you use Linux\u2019s software RAID If you use a RAID controller with battery-backed-up memory.
